Workato
Workato also provides a Connector SDK that handles and abstracts multiple aspects of application and data integration for cases where custom development is required. Existing connectors can be extended via the SDK or via adding functions from the REST connector

Recipes are automated workflows built by users that can span multiple apps, such as moving new accounts from Salesforce into Zendesk as new organizations. Each recipe comprises of a trigger and one or more actions that are carried out when a trigger event is picked up.



7
Workato
Triggers determine what event to listen to execute the actions described in a recipe.

Trigger events can be set off in apps (Salesforce or JIRA) when a certain event happens (new contact is created or existing ticket updated), when a new line is added in a file, or according to a schedule (fires at a certain time or interval).



8
Workato
Every step, including triggers, brings data into the recipe. For example a new employee in Workday trigger would bring in employee data. This data is made available in the recipe via the datatree.

The individual data fields are called datapills. You can use the datapills in subsequent steps.

Typosquatting is a form of cybercrime that involves hackers registering domains with deliberately misspelled names of well-known websites. Hackers do this to lure unsuspecting visitors to alternative websites, typically for malicious purposes. Visitors may end up at these alternative websites through one of two ways:

By inadvertently mistyping the name of popular websites into their web browser – e.g. gooogle.com instead of google.com.
Being lured to them as part of a broader phishing attack.

What is an agreed upon procedures (AUP) engagement?
Consulting services, in contrast, may include advice or technical assistance that’s only for the business’s internal purposes. As such, lenders and other third parties can’t rely on the findings, conclusions, and recommendations presented during a consulting project.

All of the good attackers are very good at impersonation. This usually starts with a pretext which is simply a lie that sets up the entire scenario for the attack. There is usually an actor, the person trying to pull off the scam, and a story.



18
Security+
Once the attacker has the person at easy, they can start extracting information very easily from that person. This is called eliciting information from the end user.

A computer hoax is a threat that doesn't actually exist, but it seems like it could be real. They still consume lots of resources in the form of forwarded email messages, printed memorandums, and wasted time.



22

Spam received over instant messaging or text messaging is referred to as SPIM.



26

Regardless of the content of the spam message the problem for the system administrator is many and varied.

  Security concerns
  resource utilization (network bandwidth, time)
  storage costs
  spam management system cost



27

Spam prevention measures include

  Allowed list - only receive messages from trusted senders
  SMTP standards checking - block anything that doesn't follow RFC standards
  Reverse DNS (rDNS) - block email where the sender's domain does not match the IP address
  Tarpitting - intentionally slsow down the server conversation 
  Recipient filtering - Block all email not addressed to a valid recipient email address

A social engineering attack that’s a little more unusual but still quite effective is the credential harvesting attack. Credential harvesting is when the attackers are trying to gain access to your usernames and passwords that might be stored on your local computer. We often have these credentials that are stored in our browser or on our operating system, and obviously the attackers would love to have a copy of all of your usernames and all of your passwords.

Celonis 
The Celonis Software is also known as the Celonis Execution Management System (short EMS). The Celonis EMS has Process Mining technology at its core. Just like the field of Process Mining the Celonis EMS has developed from an historical analytical tool towards an action-oriented operational backbone in enterprises.

Process mining is the process of using event data to improve some kind of process to improve performance and ensure compliance.



17
Celonis
There are three mandatory fields for an event: 
  Case identifier,
  Activity, 
  Timestamp



18
Celonis
A sequence of activities for a specific case is called a trace. Traces are used to automatically generate process models with varying levels of detail. Models that are simplified and show only the most common traces are made by filtering data.



19
Celonis
Event data frequently has all kinds of issues, for example quality. After data is cleaned up, process models are created automatically with process discovery techniques.



20
Celonis
Once we have the process models we would like to use, we can look at the event data for bottlenecks to improve performance or conformance.



21
Celonis
Machine learning techniques do not deal with event data well. When combined with process models, it becomes possible to generate insights like where bottlenecks may form in the future.



22
Celonis
Conformance testing is comparing process model behavior with ideal behavior



23
Celonis
Comparative process mining is comparing the same process or two different process to find out what we can improve. For example, in a large organizationship with different offices, the processes used in different offices can be compared to look for improvements



24
Celonis
Predictive process mining is trying to find out what is going to happen to take action
