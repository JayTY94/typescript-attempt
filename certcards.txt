RDS Read Replicas allow you to run multiple copies of your database. These copies only allow reads (no writes) and are intended to alleviate the workload of your primary database and improve performance.



2
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS Read Replicas use Asynchronous replication




3
AWS SysOps Admin
You must have automatic backups enabled to use read replicas with RDS.




4
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS can have up to 5 read replicas at a time




5
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS can combine read replicas and multi-AZ




6
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS can have read replicas in another region, called Cross-Region Read Replicas.




7
AWS SysOps Admin
RDS Multi-AZ replicas can be promoted to their own database, but this breaks replication.




8
AWS SysOps Admin
You can have Multi-AZ replicas of read replicas

AWS SysOps Admin
RDS has 2 backup solutions: Automated Backs and Database Snapshots



10
AWS SysOps Admin
With RDS Automated Backups, you choose a retention period between 1 and 35 days. There is no additional cost for backup storage. You define your backup window.




11
AWS SysOps Admin
With RDS Manual Snapshots, you manually create backups. If you delete your primary, the manual snapshots will still exist and can be restored.



12
AWS SysOps Admin
When you restore an RDS instance, it will create a new database. You will need to delete your old database and point new traffic to the new database restored from the backup.




13
AWS SysOps Admin
You can turn on encryption at-rest for RDS via KMS.



14
AWS SysOps Admin
The management account – The AWS Control Tower management account is part of the Root level. The management account allows for AWS Control Tower billing. The account also has administrator permissions for your landing zone. You cannot create separate accounts for billing and for administrator permissions in AWS Control Tower.

Cloud formation Change sets
If you need to make changes to the running resources in a stack, you update the stack. Before making changes to your resources, you can generate a change set, which is a summary of your proposed changes. Change sets allow you to see how your changes might impact your running resources, especially for critical resources, before implementing them.



16
AWS SysOps Admin
In CloudFormation, a resource declaration begins with a string that specifies the logical name for that resource. The logical name can be used to refer to resources within the template.

Anything in the 10.207.0.0/16 CIDR block is at S24.



18
AWS SysOps Admin
You use the Parameters section of a CloudFormation template to declare values that can be passed to the template when you create the stack. A parameter is an effective way to specify sensitive information, such as user names and passwords, that you don't want to store in the template itself



19
AWS SysOps Admin
Parameters in a CloudFormation template provide a way to specify information that might be unique to the specific application or configuration you are deploying, for example, a domain name or instance type.

Making KACE tickets in the portal for some reason does not notify the ticket owner. Alan just emails helpdesk@hemic.com and then adjusts the values afterward.



21
AWS SysOps Admin
If CloudFormation can't create a resource, it reports a CREATE_FAILED event and, by default, rolls back the stack and deletes any resources that have been created. The Status Reason column displays the issue that caused the failure.

In VB.NET, to check if an element is contained in a collection/enumerable, use
if collection.contains(element)

AWS SysOps Admin
A namespace is a container for CloudWatch metrics. Metrics in different namespaces are isolated from each other, so that metrics from different applications are not mistakenly aggreated into the same statistics.





24
AWS SysOps Admin
The AWS CloudWatch namespaces typically use the following naming convention: AWS/service. For example, Amazon EC2 uses the AWS/EC2 namespace.



25
AWS SysOps Admin
Metrics are the fundamental concept in CloudWatch. A metric represents a time-ordered set of data points that are published to CloudWatch. Think of a metric as a variable to monitor, and the data points as representing the values of that variable over time.




26
AWS SysOps Admin
Metrics are uniquesly defined by a name, namespace, and zero or more dimensions. Each data point in a metric has a time stamp, and (optionally) a unit of measure. You can retrieve statistics from CloudWatch for any metric.




27
AWS SysOps Admin
Each CloudWatch metric data point must be associated with a time stamp. The time stamp can be up to two weeks in the past and up to two hours into the future.



28
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudWatch alarms check metrics based on the current time in UTC. Custom metrics sent to CloudWatch with time stamps other than the current UTC time can cause alarms to display the Insufficient Data state or result in delayed alamrs.

Eating your own dog food, drinking your own champagne, eating your own caviar – some sound more appetizing than others. Whichever phrase you choose, this is tech industry shorthand for the use of one’s own products. More specifically, it’s when a company uses its own products to find and resolve bugs

An SMTP relay is an email relay service that basically works in two steps:

It receives the outgoing mail from the sender (that is, your amazing Groundhog Day’s email campaign).
It delivers it to the recipient’s local post office, another SMTP server.

AWS CloudFormation Templates include several major sections. The Resources section is the only required section.



19
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template secion: Format version (optional)
  The AWS CloudFormation template version that the template conforms to. The template format version isn't hte same as the API or VSDL version. The template format version can change independently of the API and WSDL versions.



20
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Description (optional)
  A text string that describes the template. This seciotn must always follow the templat format version section.




21
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Metadata (optional)
Objects that provide additional information about the template.



22
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Parameters (optional)
Values to pass to your temmplate (when you create or update the stack). You can refer to parameters from the Resources or Ouputs section of the template.



23
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template Section: Rules (optional)
  Validates a parameter or a combination of parameters passed to a template during a stack creation or stack update




24
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template Section: Mappings (optional)

A mapping of keys and associated values that you can use to speicy conditional parameter values, similar to a lookup table. YOu can match a key to a corresponding value by using the Fn::FindInMap intrinsic function in the Resources and Outputs sections.



25
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Conditions (optional)

Conditions that control whether certain resources are creaetd or whether certain resource properties are assigned a value during stack creation or update. For example, you could conditionally create a resource that depends on whether the stack is for a prduciton or test environment.



26
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Transform (optional)

For serverless applications (also referered to as Lambda-based applications), specifies the version of the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to use. When you specify a transform, you can use AWS SAM syntax to declare resources in your template. The model defines the syntax that you can use and how it's processed.



27
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Resources (required)

Specifies the stack resources and their properties, such as Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute instances or Amazon Simple Store Services buckets. You can refer to the resources in the Resources and Outputs sections of the template.



28
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Outputs (optional)

Describes the values that are returned whenever you view your stack's properties. For example, you can declare an output for an S3 bucket name and then call the aws cloudformation describe-stacks AWS CLI command to view the name.
