Eating your own dog food, drinking your own champagne, eating your own caviar – some sound more appetizing than others. Whichever phrase you choose, this is tech industry shorthand for the use of one’s own products. More specifically, it’s when a company uses its own products to find and resolve bugs

It receives the outgoing mail from the sender (that is, your amazing Groundhog Day’s email campaign).
It delivers it to the recipient’s local post office, another SMTP server.

CloudFormation Template section: Conditions (optional)

Conditions that control whether certain resources are creaetd or whether certain resource properties are assigned a value during stack creation or update. For example, you could conditionally create a resource that depends on whether the stack is for a prduciton or test environment.

Structured documents generally focus on collecting information in a precise format, guiding the person who is filling them with precise areas where each piece of data needs to be entered.  These come in a fixed form and are generally called forms.  

Examples of structured documents: Surveys, questionnaires, Tax forms. These contain exclusively key-value pairs and tables. 




2
UiPath 
Semi-structured documents are documents that do not follow a strict format the way structured forms do and are not bound to specified data fields.  These don't have a fixed form but follow a common enough format.  They may contain paragraphs as well, but data is mainly to be found in key-value pairs. 

Examples of semi-structured documents: Invoices, Receipts, Purchase Orders, Healthcare lab reports. 


3
UiPath 
Unstructured documents are documents in which the information isn't organized according to a clear, structured model. These files are all easily comprehensible by human beings, yet much more difficult for a robot.

Examples of unstructured documents: Contracts, Annual Reports. Some may contain key-value pairs and tables, but much of the data is in unstructured form inside the text.

An r-value is a temporary value that does not persist beyond the expression that uses it.

The notion of l-values and r-values was introduced by Combined Programming Language (CPL).

Procedural Code makes it easy to add new functions, but hard to add new classes. The inverse is true for Object Oriented code.

The Law of Demeter (LoD) or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs. In its general form, the LoD is a specific case of loose coupling. 

Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
Only talk to your immediate friends.

CTEXT control defines a centered-text control. The control is a simple rectangle displaying the given text centered in the rectangle. The text is formatted before it is displayed. Words that would extend past the end of a line are automatically wrapped to the beginning of the next line. Words that are longer than the width of the control are truncated.

Your /scratch folder (scratchDir) is meant to be a space for temporary files, even large ones, and is ideal for jobs that do a lot of file accesses (reading, writing, etc.) and/or consume a lot of disk space. You can modify your programs so that the first step is to copy the files to /scratch before processing them.
