Azure Database for MySQL - a simple-to-use open-source database management system that is commonly used in Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) stack apps.





12
Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure Database for MariaDB - a newer database management system, created by the original developers of MySQL. The database engine has since been rewritten and optimized to improve performance. MariaDB offers compatibility with Oracle Database (another popular commercial database management system).





13
Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure Database for PostgreSQL - a hybrid relational-object database. You can store data in relational tables, but a PostgreSQL database also enables you to store custom data types, with their own non-relational properties.

Data engineers use Azure Storage to host data lakes - blob storage with a hierarchical namespace that enables files to be organized in folders in a distributed file system.



15
Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure Cosmos DB is a global-scale non-relational (NoSQL) database system that supports multiple application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling you to store and manage data as JSON documents, key-value pairs, column-families, and graphs.

Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure Data Factory is used by data engineers to build extract, transform, and load (ETL) solutions that populate analytical data stores with data from transactional systems across the organization.





17
Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure Synapse Analytics is a comprehensive, unified data analytics solution that provides a single service interface for multiple analytical capabilities, including:
    Pipelines
    SQL
    Apache Spark
    Azure Synapse Data Explorer

Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure Databricks is an Azure-integrated version of the popular Databricks platform, which combines the Apache Spark data processing platform with SQL database semantics and an integrated management interface to enable large-scale data analytics.





19
Azure Data Fundamentals
Data engineers can incorporate Azure Stream Analytics into data analytics architectures that capture streaming data for ingestion into an analytical data store or for real-time visualization.





20
Azure Data Fundamentals
Data analysts can use Azure Data Explorer to query and analyze data that includes a timestamp attribute, such as is typically found in log files and Internet-of-things (IoT) telemetry data.






21
Azure Data Fundamentals
Which single service would you use to implement data pipelines, SQL analytics, and Spark analytics?

Azure Synapse Analytics

NOT Microsoft Power BI
NOT Azure SQL Database

Normalization is a term used by database professionals for a schema design process that minimizes data duplication and enforces data integrity.





23
Azure Data Fundamentals
Principle of Normalization 1 of 4
Separate each entity into its own table



24
Azure Data Fundamentals
Principle of Normalization 2 of 4
Separate each discrete attribute



25
Azure Data Fundamentals
Principle of Normalization 3 of 4
Uniquely identify each entity instance (row) using a primary key.



26
Azure Data Fundamentals
Principle of Normalization 4 of 4
Use foreign key columns to link related entities.

The four main DML statements are:

Statement	Description
SELECT	Read rows from a table
INSERT	Insert new rows into a table
UPDATE	Modify data in existing rows
DELETE	Delete existing rows



28
Azure Data Fundamentals
A view is a virtual table based on the results of a SELECT query. You an think of a view as a window on specified rows in one or more underlying tables. You can query the view and filter the data in much the same way as a table



29
Azure Data Fundamentals
A stored procedure defines SQL statements that can be run on command. Stored procedures are used to encapsulate programmatic logic in a database for actions that applications need to perform when working with data.






30
Azure Data Fundamentals
WHen you create an index in a database, you specify a column from the table, and the index contains a copy of this data in a sorted order, with pointers to the corresponding rows in the table. When the user runs a query that specifies this column in the WHERE clause, the database management system can use this index to fetch the data more quickly than if it had to scan the entire table row by row.

You can create many indexes on a table. However, Indexes aren't free. An index consumes storage space, and each time you insert, update, and delte data in a table, teh indexes for that table must be maintained.



2
Azure Data Fundamentals
SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) - A virtual machine running in Azure with an installation of SQL Server. The use of a VM makes this option an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solution that virtualizes hardware infrastructure for compute, storage, and networking in Azure; making it a great option for "lift and shift" migration of existing on-premises SQL Server installations to the cloud.




3
Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure SQL Managed Instance - A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) option that provides near-100% compatibility with on-premises SQL Server instances while abstracting the underlying hardware and operating system. The service includes automated software update management, backups, and other maintenance tasks, reducing the administrative burden of supporting a database server instance.




4
Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure SQL Database - A fully managed, highly scalable PaaS database service that is designed for the cloud. This service includes the core database-level capabilities of on-premises SQL Server, and is a good option when you need to create a new application in the cloud.




5
Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure SQL Edge - A SQL engine that is optimized for Internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios that need to work with streaming time-series data.




6
Azure Data Fundamentals
Managed instances depend on other Azure services such as Azure Storage for backups, Azure Event Hubs for telemetry, Azure Active Directory for authentication, Azure Key Vault for Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and a couple of Azure platform services that provide security and supportability features. The managed instances make connections to these services.

Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure SQL Database is often used for:

Modern cloud applications that need to use the latest stable SQL Server features.
Applications that require high availability.
Systems with a variable load that need the database server to scale up and down quickly.
