An SMTP relay is an email relay service that basically works in two steps:

It receives the outgoing mail from the sender (that is, your amazing Groundhog Day’s email campaign).
It delivers it to the recipient’s local post office, another SMTP server.

AWS CloudFormation Templates include several major sections. The Resources section is the only required section.



19
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template secion: Format version (optional)
  The AWS CloudFormation template version that the template conforms to. The template format version isn't hte same as the API or VSDL version. The template format version can change independently of the API and WSDL versions.



20
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Description (optional)
  A text string that describes the template. This seciotn must always follow the templat format version section.




21
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Metadata (optional)
Objects that provide additional information about the template.



22
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Parameters (optional)
Values to pass to your temmplate (when you create or update the stack). You can refer to parameters from the Resources or Ouputs section of the template.



23
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template Section: Rules (optional)
  Validates a parameter or a combination of parameters passed to a template during a stack creation or stack update




24
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template Section: Mappings (optional)

A mapping of keys and associated values that you can use to speicy conditional parameter values, similar to a lookup table. YOu can match a key to a corresponding value by using the Fn::FindInMap intrinsic function in the Resources and Outputs sections.



25
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Conditions (optional)

Conditions that control whether certain resources are creaetd or whether certain resource properties are assigned a value during stack creation or update. For example, you could conditionally create a resource that depends on whether the stack is for a prduciton or test environment.



26
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Transform (optional)

For serverless applications (also referered to as Lambda-based applications), specifies the version of the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to use. When you specify a transform, you can use AWS SAM syntax to declare resources in your template. The model defines the syntax that you can use and how it's processed.



27
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Resources (required)

Specifies the stack resources and their properties, such as Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute instances or Amazon Simple Store Services buckets. You can refer to the resources in the Resources and Outputs sections of the template.



28
AWS SysOps Admin
CloudFormation Template section: Outputs (optional)

Describes the values that are returned whenever you view your stack's properties. For example, you can declare an output for an S3 bucket name and then call the aws cloudformation describe-stacks AWS CLI command to view the name.

Structured documents generally focus on collecting information in a precise format, guiding the person who is filling them with precise areas where each piece of data needs to be entered.  These come in a fixed form and are generally called forms.  

Examples of structured documents: Surveys, questionnaires, Tax forms. These contain exclusively key-value pairs and tables. 




2
UiPath 
Semi-structured documents are documents that do not follow a strict format the way structured forms do and are not bound to specified data fields.  These don't have a fixed form but follow a common enough format.  They may contain paragraphs as well, but data is mainly to be found in key-value pairs. 

Examples of semi-structured documents: Invoices, Receipts, Purchase Orders, Healthcare lab reports.

UiPath 
Unstructured documents are documents in which the information isn't organized according to a clear, structured model. These files are all easily comprehensible by human beings, yet much more difficult for a robot.

Examples of unstructured documents: Contracts, Annual Reports. Some may contain key-value pairs and tables, but much of the data is in unstructured form inside the text.

The Law of Demeter (LoD) or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs. In its general form, the LoD is a specific case of loose coupling. 

Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
Only talk to your immediate friends.

CTEXT control defines a centered-text control. The control is a simple rectangle displaying the given text centered in the rectangle. The text is formatted before it is displayed. Words that would extend past the end of a line are automatically wrapped to the beginning of the next line. Words that are longer than the width of the control are truncated.

Your /scratch folder (scratchDir) is meant to be a space for temporary files, even large ones, and is ideal for jobs that do a lot of file accesses (reading, writing, etc.) and/or consume a lot of disk space. You can modify your programs so that the first step is to copy the files to /scratch before processing them.

Similar in name, not similar in capabilities, OCR is a method that helps in the Digitize step of the Document Understanding process. 
Document Understanding is a process enabled by UiPath's Intelligent OCR package, making full document processing possible. 




10
UiPath
Taxonomy
In this pre-processing step, you can add multiple document types and the fields you are interested in extracting.  For example, you can work with Invoices, wanting to extract the vendor and the total amount, and with medical forms, wanting to extract insured ID number and patient name.


11
UiPath 
Digitization
For non-digital (scanned) documents, in this step, you need to apply the OCR engine of your choice. The outputs of this step are the Document Object Model and a string variable containing all the document text and are passed down to the next steps.


12
UiPath 
Classification
After digitization, the document is classified. If you are working with multiple documents types in the same project, to extract data properly you need to know what type of document you're working with. The important thing is that you can use multiple classifiers in the same scope, you can configure the classifiers and, later in the framework, train them.


13
UiPath 
Extraction
Extraction is getting just the data you are interested in. For example, extracting specific data from a 5-page document is quite troublesome if you want to do it with string manipulation. In this framework, you can use different extractors, for the different document structures, in the same scope application. 


14
UiPath 
Validation
The extracted data can be validated by a human user through the Validation Station. A best practice is to build logic around the decision of adding or not a human validation step, with rules depending on the specific use case to be implemented


15
UiPath 
Export
Once you have your validated information, you can use it as it is, or save it in a DataTable format that can be converted very easy into an Excel file.

Training Classifiers and Extractors
Classification and Extraction are as efficient as the classifiers and extractors used are. If a document wasn’t classified properly, it means it was unknown to the active classifiers. The same way goes for incorrect data extraction

The Data Transfer Object Design Pattern is one of the enterprise application architecture patterns that calls for the use of objects that aggregate and encapsulate data for transfer. A Data Transfer Object is, essentially, like a data structure. It should not contain any business logic but should contain serialization and deserialization mechanisms.

In object-oriented programming, the open–closed principle states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification";[1] that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.

The essential idea is to break down writing a scenario (or test) into three sections:

The given part describes the state of the world before you begin the behavior you're specifying in this scenario. You can think of it as the pre-conditions to the test.
The when section is that behavior that you're specifying.
Finally the then section describes the changes you expect due to the specified behavior.

Following the standard Java convention, a class should begin with a list of variables. Public statick constants, if any, should come first. Then private static variables, followed by private instance vvariables. There is seldom a good reason to have a public variable.

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class or module should have one and only one reason to change. This principle gives us both a definition or responsibility, and guidelines for class size. Classes should have one responsibility--one reason to change. 

I think he means to handle more specific cases in subclasses.

Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff.

Definition of the Dependency Inversion Principle
The general idea of this principle is as simple as it is important: High-level modules, which provide complex logic, should be easily reusable and unaffected by changes in low-level modules, which provide utility features. To achieve that, you need to introduce an abstraction that decouples the high-level and low-level modules from each other.

Cross-cutting concerns are parts of a program that rely on or must affect many other parts of the system. They form the basis for the development of aspects.[1] Such cross-cutting concerns do not fit cleanly into object-oriented programming or procedural programming.[2]

Cross-cutting concerns can be directly responsible for tangling, or system inter-dependencies, within a program.

The Taxonomy is automatically created when you first open the Taxonomy Manager. It is saved in the project folder, under Document Processing. It takes the form of a JSON file and it's important to remember that you can have only one taxonomy file per project.
