A common problem when cleaning data is the swapped day/month timestamp. The Europeans are very high handed about the fact that the Americans do MM/dd/yyyy and they do dd/MM/yyyy



12
Celonis
A data pool is the main structural element of the event collection. Data pools cluster data connections, data jobs, schedules, and data models.



13
Celonis
To analyze data, we must first create a process data model.
  First we have to select the tables that need to be added to the model.
  Then we need to define the activity table
  Then we assign the three core columns
  Lastly, models need to be loaded.



14
Celonis
The activity table in celonis is the event table including the case ID, activity, and the timestamp.



15
Celonis
Many additional columns often includ case specific information, for example, the price of the purchase order. This can lead to data replication in the event log. This can be mitigated by saving multiple tables connected by foreign keys.



16
Celonis
Data is always arranged in a process data model that consists of an activity table, a case table, and an unlimited number of aditional tables with relations of the tables defined by the foreign keys.



17
Celonis
What are the challenges when extracting event data?
  Finding the data - ID the system that will be the source
  Extracting the data - setting up the pipeline
  Understand the data - know the schema/foreign key relationships



18
Celonis
What are the challenges when extracting event data?
  Quality problems - eg MM/DD/yyyy or DD/MM/yyyy
  Scalability - manually uploading data is too limited
  Data security and regulations



19
Celonis
An important aspect of that is the existence of common and widely-accepted standards, one of it being the data format for event logs.  XES is an XML-based format, and its name is an acronym for eXtensible Event Stream



20
Celonis
There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Deficiency - Events disappear from the data set due to missing representation in the flattened event log.



21
Celonis
There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Convergence - Unintentional duplication due to events referring to multiple objects being replicated




22
Celonis
There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Divergence - Wrong causal relation, 2 events being related to 2 different object not selected as the case.



23
Celonis
We distinguish between two features types. Static features do not change throughout a case and always remain the same. Examples could be Customer or Material Number.



24
Celonis
We distinguish between two features types. Dynamic features are features that change over time and need to be updated throughout a case. Examples are counts of how often a certain activity already occurred in the process.



25
Celonis
When building a training set Static and Dynamic features need to be treated differently since they should not have the last state of a case but the state at a given time in the process.



26
Celonis
If you're looking for operational friction, focus on the cases that are infrequent and that you don't want to happen.



27
Celonis
Machine Learning can be applied after data is imported, cleaned, analyized, and reorganized into feature sets. This is one of the last things that Celonis can do, and it's unlikely that our customers will get to it.



28
Celonis
Machine Learning in Celonis is demonstrated to help predict with real time data which cases are likely to be delayed so that corrective action can be taken. Again, this is probably beyond the capacity of Hawaii companies to use.



29
General 
The Pareto principle or "80-20 rule" stating that 80% of outcomes are due to 20% of causes was named in honour of Pareto, but the concepts are distinct, and only Pareto distributions with shape value (α) of log45 ≈ 1.16 precisely reflect it. Empirical observation has shown that this 80-20 distribution fits a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena[5] and human activities.[6][7] the principle originally applied to describing the distribution of wealth in a society, fitting the trend that a large portion of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population



30
Celonis
Action Flows allows users to deploy any of around 10k pre-built automations for a number of existing connected services.




1
Celonis
What does the Pareto distribution tell us in relation to processes?
  80% of the cases, is explained by only 20% of variants. 
  Infrequent variants often correspond to problems in the process.

Celonis' partner program »AcCelorate« is designed to enable you to expand your business in collaboration with Celonis. It is a multi-level program that gives you the freedom to choose how you want to collaborate with Celonis to generate a joint value proposition and be rewarded accordingly. 





7
Celonis
AcCelorate offers a point-based structure to recognize and reward partners for the multiple ways in which we collaborate together. Collaboration parameters are defined within three partner performance areas that reflect our Ecosystem value proposition.



8
Celonis
The CREATE performance area of the AcCelorate program rewards partners for building and launching their own assets on the Celonis EMS platform. You can strengthen your position by creating tailored solutions for use cases like waste reduction or carbon emission tracking and get rewarded.

Rewards are up to 200 points.



9
Celonis
The MARKET performance area of the AcCelorate program focuses on how we work together to bring the power of EMS to the market and joinly earn the trust of existing and new customers.

Rewards are up to 500 points:
- 300 points according to ACV sales
- 200 points for new customers



10
Celonis
ACV (annual contract value) is a key metric that shows you how much an ongoing customer contract is worth by averaging and normalizing its value over one year.

ACV sales calculations are typically based on the recurring revenue generated by a single client or account and don’t normally include initial or one-time setup, training or administrative fees.



11
Celonis
The DELIVER performance area of the AcCelorate program is about partners implementing and driving continuous customer value by means of the technical implementation of the Celonis EMS and/or driving business value by leaverageing it.

Rewards are up to 300 points:
- 200 points for project engagements
- 100 points for success stories



12
Celonis
All Training Tracks, across all levels, are available free of charge. Certification exams cost $150 USD each (incl. 2 attempts) and are valid for one year. The yearly renewal subscription has a total cost of $100 USD. 





13
Celonis
Your organization must hold at minimum 6 Expert badges to hold Celonis certified partner status (at least 1x Value Assessment, 1x EMS Technical Expert, and 1x Value Realization Expert). One person can hold multiple Expert badges and each one will still count individually towards your total.



14
Celonis
Celopeers is a space for exchange and support for all Celonis users, whether you have a product-related question or want to share an idea for a new feature. Engage with other partners, customers, and Celonauts to share experiences, best practices, and ideas.



15
Celonis
The Celonis Help Space contains documentation, guidelines, and answers to the most common technical questions you might have. The Help Space can be accessed through any Celonis Instance (e.g., your personal Celonis EMS Training Environment or Celonis Sandbox) by clicking on the "Need Help?" tab.



16
Celonis
The Partner Portal has been introduced before, but its library's value & depth deserves an additional listing at this point. The library contains several hundreds of assets from template presentations, event recordings, program & tools guidelines to marketing & sales collaterals. 



17
Celonis
On top of the Activity table, you also have additional tables such as the Case table which points to all of the ordered items you follow—i.e. all the "cases"—and other master data tables that provide extra context such as seller, product details and so on. 



18
Celonis
In other words, in Data Integration, you lay the data pipeline foundation for Celonis implementations and are also responsible for its ongoing optimization and expansion.



19
Celonis
To speed up your work in Data Integration, Celonis provides "Process Connectors" for the most common processes in systems. Process Connectors contain preset templates and scripts that support you in the connect, extract, transform, load, and scheduling steps of building your data pipeline. Here is an idea of what to expect for each step:



20
Celonis
Breadcrumbs at the top left of any Data Integration screen:
This shows you at all times in what "Data Pool" you are. You can think of Data Pools as independent databases in Data Integration.  



21
Celonis
Celonis recommends aiming for real-time setups from the start where possible to maximize value from the EMS' capabilities. Even if projects initially do not require real-time data, it's safe to assume that many analytical or process mining projects eventually evolve into operational or execution use cases.



22
Celonis
 By restricting the data you load and its timeframe, the data model is updated in close to real-time which allows users to act on  it. In other words, the operational data model is smaller, loads faster and is the one business users use in day-to-day business. 



23
Celonis
In parallel, you may have a full scope analytical data model with regular complete loads of the data. With this model, your analysts can drill down into processes, look for patterns, filter and so on. These "post-hoc" (after-the-fact) analyses do not necessarily require real-time data



24
Celonis
Currently, real-time data integration applies only to the Extract and Transform phases but not the Data Model Load. For the Data Model Load, updating tables with only their changes is currently not possible. Note that this may change in the future.



25
Celonis
Note that real-time is not available for all systems—currently only for SAP, Salesforce, JDBC (Databases), Azure Event Hub, Azure Service Bus, and Kafka. Also note that the approach behind real-time for each of these systems differs based on the source system's capabilities. 



26
Celonis
Look for Process Connectors in the Marketplace whenever possible. If no Connectors are available, you can of course put in a request for Celonis to create one (reach out servicedesk@celonis.com) but do not wait.




27
Celonis
If no Connectors are available, you can of course put in a request for Celonis to create one (reach out servicedesk@celonis.com) but do not wait. You can connect to systems neutrally and extract data with the Extractors (Data Connections). Or you build your own connection and extraction with the Extractor Builder.



28
Celonis
For one-time or static cases use the File Upload.
Use the Data Push API if the use case requires you to push data such as existing ETL tools or scheduled reports.



29
Celonis
if you are apt with Python and want to control every aspect of your extractor, you can consider the Celoxtractor.



30
Celonis
In preparing systems for a connection, you need to consider whether:
the hosting environment is closed (most cases on-premise)—then you install the Celonis Extractor on premise and use an uplink connection to the EMS



1
Celonis
In preparing systems for a connection, you need to consider whether:
the hosting environment is open (most cases cloud)—then you use the default Celonis Cloud Extractor with a direct connection to the EMS


2
Celonis
In preparing systems for a connection, you need to consider whether:
your connection is real-time—you then need to set up Log tables and triggers in the source system environment.

Celonis
Data pools are containers for all other elements in Data Integration - Data Connections, Data Jobs, and Data Models. They pool your data. If you plan to bring together multiple systems and processes in your EMS, aligning your plans with Data Integration’s structural elements is very important and will save you re-structuring work later down the line.





4
Celonis
Data Pool: 
  Hosts one or more Data Connections

Data Connection: 
  Contian one or more Data Jobs



5
Celonis
Data Jobs 
  Contain "tasks" for extraction, transformation, and Data Model load

Data Model
  Pull data from all connections in one Data Pool



6
Celonis
What is the main difference between connecting Celonis to a closed vs open hosting environment?
D. For closed environments, the Extractor Server is installed in the hosting environment.

Celonis
Capture stage of Task Mining

Here you capture desktop data like clicks, scrolls, and user actions--complete with time-stamps and other screenshots. This is done using the Task Mining Client and is possible on Windows Desktops. Once captured, data is regularly sent to the EMS.

The Task Mining client runs in the background and only captures allow-listed applications and data.



8
Celonis
Enrich stage of Task Mining

Add Context & Cluster Activities -- Within the EMS,  AI and ML are used to contextualize the data.

This enables the grouping of desktop events by activity--such as "creating a support ticket"



9
Celonis
Match stage of Task Mining

Match to Business Data -- Here, Task Mining Data can optionally be matched to Business Data from transactional systems based on e.g. user and case IDs, activity names, and timestamps. This helps understand the impact of desktop activities on business processes and supports the next step--Execute



10
Celonis
Execute

Execute and Optimize -- In the final step, you leverage Task Mining data to optimize processes, increase your execution capacity, and ultimately boost your business performance using an Execution Management System.



11
Celonis
Celonis Task Mining is designed with a focus on data protection principles. These principles and Task Mining capabilities highlighted below are largely based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Keep in mind, you can of course adjust Task Mining's capabilities to any other data regulation. 



12
Celonis
Pseudonymization (or pseudonymisation, the spelling under European guidelines) is one way to comply with the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) demands for secure data storage of personal information. 



13
Celonis
Pseudonymized data can be restored to its original state with the addition of information which allows individuals to be re-identified. In contrast, anonymization is intended to prevent re-identification of individuals within the dataset.[2]



14
Celonis
Configuration & Status: The Task Mining Client periodically checks the central configuration stored in the EMS Task Mining Service. This configuration determines many factors such as which applications you track, filters you apply, pseudonymization, whether screenshots are captured, and so on.
