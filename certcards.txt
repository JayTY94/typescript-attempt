Workato
Workato also provides a Connector SDK that handles and abstracts multiple aspects of application and data integration for cases where custom development is required. Existing connectors can be extended via the SDK or via adding functions from the REST connector

Recipes are automated workflows built by users that can span multiple apps, such as moving new accounts from Salesforce into Zendesk as new organizations. Each recipe comprises of a trigger and one or more actions that are carried out when a trigger event is picked up.



7
Workato
Triggers determine what event to listen to execute the actions described in a recipe.

Trigger events can be set off in apps (Salesforce or JIRA) when a certain event happens (new contact is created or existing ticket updated), when a new line is added in a file, or according to a schedule (fires at a certain time or interval).



8
Workato
Every step, including triggers, brings data into the recipe. For example a new employee in Workday trigger would bring in employee data. This data is made available in the recipe via the datatree.

The individual data fields are called datapills. You can use the datapills in subsequent steps.

Typosquatting is a form of cybercrime that involves hackers registering domains with deliberately misspelled names of well-known websites. Hackers do this to lure unsuspecting visitors to alternative websites, typically for malicious purposes. Visitors may end up at these alternative websites through one of two ways:

All of the good attackers are very good at impersonation. This usually starts with a pretext which is simply a lie that sets up the entire scenario for the attack. There is usually an actor, the person trying to pull off the scam, and a story.

Credential harvesting is when the attackers are trying to gain access to your usernames and passwords that might be stored on your local computer.
