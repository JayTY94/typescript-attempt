Learning Tests:
When developing with a new API, write a test that verifies your expectation of how that API will behave.



21
Clean Code, Uncle Bob
The essential idea is to break down writing a scenario (or test) into three sections:

The given part describes the state of the world before you begin the behavior you're specifying in this scenario. You can think of it as the pre-conditions to the test.
The when section is that behavior that you're specifying.
Finally the then section describes the changes you expect due to the specified behavior.

FIRST Tests:
  Fast
  Independent
  Repeatable
  Self-Validating
  Timely

Following the standard Java convention, a class should begin with a list of variables. Public statick constants, if any, should come first. Then private static variables, followed by private instance vvariables. There is seldom a good reason to have a public variable.



24
Clean Code, Uncle Bob
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class or module should have one and only one reason to change. This principle gives us both a definition or responsibility, and guidelines for class size. Classes should have one responsibility--one reason to change.

I think he means to handle more specific cases in subclasses.

Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff.

Definition of the Dependency Inversion Principle
The general idea of this principle is as simple as it is important: High-level modules, which provide complex logic, should be easily reusable and unaffected by changes in low-level modules, which provide utility features. To achieve that, you need to introduce an abstraction that decouples the high-level and low-level modules from each other.

elide
verb
  omit (a sound or syllable) when speaking.
  "English speakers often elide the vowel completely"

  join together; merge.
  "whole periods of time are elided into a few seconds of screen time"

Clean Code, Uncle Bob
Cross-cutting concerns are parts of a program that rely on or must affect many other parts of the system. They form the basis for the development of aspects.[1] Such cross-cutting concerns do not fit cleanly into object-oriented programming or procedural programming.[2]

Cross-cutting concerns can be directly responsible for tangling, or system inter-dependencies, within a program.

The Taxonomy is automatically created when you first open the Taxonomy Manager. It is saved in the project folder, under Document Processing. It takes the form of a JSON file and it's important to remember that you can have only one taxonomy file per project.

UiPath Document Understanding
one of the two outcomes of digitization is a Document Object Model. This contains basic information regarding the processed document such as name, content type, text length, and information about each page.  It is passed down to the next activities through the use of a document variable.

The other outcome of the digitization process is all the text from the document, stored in a string variable.

Classification is done through the Classify Document Scope and it's performed by classifiers.

Basically, the document text and object model resulted in the digitization steps are sent to the Classifiers, which report what types they recognize within the incoming file.

What happens if a document is not classified correctly...

  1. If training step is implemented, the classifier will get more accurate over time.

What happens if a document is not classified correctly...

  2. The robot tries to extract values for the fields defined in the Taxonomy for classification made

  3. You can correct the classification in the Validation Station.

Why do you need to map the fields in hte Extractor configuration when using the MS Extractor?

  Some extractors have their own Taxonomy, which is why you need to map the fields - this is the case for the ML Extractor.

UiPath Document Understanding
Take this scenario: you need to extract data from medical records, but all the documents come in a single PDF file.  Based on a list of classification results, you loop through each and perform data extraction.

What arguments do you add in the data extraction scope? Select all that apply.
  Taxaonomy
  Document path
  Document Object Model
  Document Text
  Validated Classification Result

Select all of the extractors you would use to extract data from a semi-structured document.

  The Regex extractor
  The Machine Learning Extractor
  NOT
  The Form Extractor
  The Intelligent Form Extractor

Select all the actions that you can perform inside the Validation Station
  Change extracted value
  Add an additional value
  Add rows and cell values to a Table
  Correct classification results

What are the mandatory steps for processing a document with the intelligent OCR activities.
  Digitize Document
  Create the Taxonomy
  Loading the Taxonomy
  Data Extraction with at least one Extractor



11

[true] You can extract data from rotated or skewed documents.

The Configure Classifiers Wizard accessed via the Train Classifiers Scope allows you to choose which classifiers are trained for each document type.

A DataTable is an in-memory representation of a single database table which has collection of rows and columns where as a DataSet is an in-memory representation of a database-like structure which has a collection of DataTables.

The Train Classifiers Scope empowers the closing of the feedback loop to any classification algorithm capable of learning. Drag and drop your classifier trainers within this Scope activity and enable them using the Configure Classifiers wizard to ensure that the information validated by humans through the Classification Station or Validation Station is used by your classifiers to improve their own performance.

UiPath Document Understanding
The Machine Learning Extractor leverages the power of AI and Machine Learning to identify information in structured or semi-structured documents by either using one of  UiPath's public data extraction services or by calling custom trained Machine Learning models that you can build and host in AI Fabric. This activity is part of the UiPath.DocumentUnderstanding.ML.Activities package.

You can also enable human validation through Long-Running Workflows, optimizing human-robot collaboration. The Create Document Validation Action and the Wait for Document Validation Action and Resume activities enable this scenario.

Tasks are stored in projects and make it clear who's responsible for what by when. Tasks store all files, messages, and instructions related to it so they're easy to find in one place.




22
Asana
Portfolios store groups of projects. You can use them to see all the projects and status updates towards an initiative or objective in one place.
