Azure Data Fundamentals
You can create many indexes on a table. However, Indexes aren't free. An index consumes storage space, and each time you insert, update, and delte data in a table, teh indexes for that table must be maintained.

SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) - A virtual machine running in Azure with an installation of SQL Server. The use of a VM makes this option an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solution that virtualizes hardware infrastructure for compute, storage, and networking in Azure; making it a great option for "lift and shift" migration of existing on-premises SQL Server installations to the cloud.

Azure SQL Managed Instance - A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) option that provides near-100% compatibility with on-premises SQL Server instances while abstracting the underlying hardware and operating system. The service includes automated software update management, backups, and other maintenance tasks, reducing the administrative burden of supporting a database server instance.

Azure SQL Database - A fully managed, highly scalable PaaS database service that is designed for the cloud. This service includes the core database-level capabilities of on-premises SQL Server, and is a good option when you need to create a new application in the cloud.

Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure SQL Edge - A SQL engine that is optimized for Internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios that need to work with streaming time-series data.

Azure Data Fundamentals
Managed instances depend on other Azure services such as Azure Storage for backups, Azure Event Hubs for telemetry, Azure Active Directory for authentication, Azure Key Vault for Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and a couple of Azure platform services that provide security and supportability features. The managed instances make connections to these services.

Azure SQL Database is often used for:

Modern cloud applications that need to use the latest stable SQL Server features.
Applications that require high availability.
Systems with a variable load that need the database server to scale up and down quickly.

Azure Data Fundamentals
Elastic Pool
This option is similar to Single Database, except that by default multiple databases can share the same resources, such as memory, data storage space, and processing power through multiple-tenancy. The resources are referred to as a pool. This model is useful if you have databases with resource requirements that vary over time, and can help you to reduce costs.

PostgreSQL is a hybrid relational-object database. You can store data in relational tables, but a PostgreSQL database also enables you to store custom data types, with their own non-relational properties
