Cryptographic nonce
Arbitrary number, used once
	Comes from phrase "for the nonce" or "for the time being"
A random or pseudo-random number
	Something that can't be reasonably guessed, but can also be a counter
Use a nonce during a login process
	Server gives you a nonce
	Calculate your password hash using the nonce
	Each password hash sent to the host will be different, so a replay won't work



17
Security+
A type of nonce we commonly use in encryption is an Initialization Vector, or an IV. This is a way to add randomization to the encryption scheme that’s being used. If we’re able to add this initialization vector to an encryption key that we’re using, especially a key that we’re using over and over again, it will make the overall encryption method that much stronger

23
Automation Hub
The Enterprise community offers many ways of contributing to the RPA program outside the automation idea submission



24
Automation Hub
The automation initiatives are at the core of any RPA program. In Automation Hub they are called automation ideas, because this is how they originate. And even as they advance through their lifecycle by being assessed, qualified and finally implemented, we continue calling them automation ideas.



25
Automation Hub
Reusable Components

Simply put, these are reusable parts of the automations being developed, such as custom activities, templates or connectors. Having these available in a single place drives effectiveness, by avoiding duplication of efforts, as well as code quality. That's exactly what Automation Hub offers through the component gallery feature.





26
Automation Hub
People

Automation Hub is the place for all the employees that want to contribute to and benefit from automation. They submit ideas and components, they collaborate in the lifecycle of an automation, or simply engage with the other users or ideas that they are interested in.





27
Automation Hub
Automations*

These are attended automation projects developed by Citizen Developers, shared for consumption through Automation Hub. Users may explore and request them. Once provided, they can be used in the daily work.



28
Automation Hub
Standard User role - They have access to explore the existing automations, to submit new ideas, manage their components, or download components available on the platform. All users have this permission assigned by default after their account is created. Other permissions can be added on top of it



29
Automation Hub
Idea Approver role - Responsible for pushing forward ideas by identifying duplicates, approving and rejecting ideas submitted by the standard users.



30
Automation Hub
	• Authorized User role - This user role offers access to the Submit an idea - CoE-driven functionality, which allows for an idea to be submitted with the detailed assessment filled in.





1
Automation Hub
	• Program Manager role - This user role is usually assigned to the Center of Excellence leader and allows them to manage the pipeline and access the dashboards and reports to make decisions on the automation program

On-Path browser attack
What if the middleman was on the same computer as the victim?
	Malware/Trojan does all of the proxy work
	Formerly known as man-in-the-browser
Huge advantages for the attackers
	Relatively easy to proxy encrypted traffic
	Everything looks normal to the victim



13
Security+
Lan switching
Forward or drop frames
	Based on the destination MAC address
Switches gather a constantly updating list of MAC addresses
	Builds the list based on teh source MAC address of incoming traffic
	These age out periodically, often in 5 minutes
Maintain a loop-free environment
	Using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)



14
Security+
MAC flooding
The MAC table on a switch is only so big
Attacker starts sending traffic with different MAC addressses
	Forces out he legitimate MAC addresses
The table fills up
	Switch begins flooding server traffic to all interfaces



15
Security+
Mac flooding
Effectively turns a switch into a hub
	All traffic is transmitted to all interfaces
	No interruption in traffic flows
Attacker can easily capture all network traffic
Flooding can be restricted in the switch's port security setting



16
Security+
MAC cloning/MAC spoofing
An attacker changes their MAC address to match the MAC of an existing device
This allows them to circumvent filters
	Wireless or wired MAC filters
	Identify a valid MAC address and copy it




17
Security+
MAC cloning/MAC spoofing
Create a Denial of Service (DoS)
	Intercept and thus deny all communication the legitimate device receives
Easily manipulated through software
	Usually a device driver option
