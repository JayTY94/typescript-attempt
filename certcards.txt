A social engineering attack thatâ€™s a little more unusual but still quite effective is the credential harvesting attack. Credential harvesting is when the attackers are trying to gain access to your usernames and passwords that might be stored on your local computer. We often have these credentials that are stored in our browser or on our operating system, and obviously the attackers would love to have a copy of all of your usernames and all of your passwords.

The Celonis Software is also known as the Celonis Execution Management System (short EMS). The Celonis EMS has Process Mining technology at its core. Just like the field of Process Mining the Celonis EMS has developed from an historical analytical tool towards an action-oriented operational backbone in enterprises.

Celonis 
The Celonis Software includes the chance to upload data from scratch or build direct connectors to source systems (Event Collection), a Celonis Studio to build analyses and integrate Action Flows and a Machine Learning Workbench to run predictions and even import e.g. Python or R packages.

Celonis
Why is the Celonis EMS an evolutionary step from process mining?

Because it builds on process mining to improve business execution by orchestrating systems and offering intelligent targeted actions






5
Celonis
The EMS Integrates data across systems, desktops, documents, and/or event streams
The EMS X-Rays processes for inefficiencies and recommend improvements
The EMS Executes on insights automatically and orchestrates existing technologies



6
Celonis
In the EMS, 
  Data Tools are a technology that supports extraction, transformation, and consolidation of data.
  Intelligence Software are a technology that enables insights to be automatically or manually extracted from data.
  Action-enabling Technologies enable integration, automation, or orchestration.

Process mining is the process of using event data to improve some kind of process to improve performance and ensure compliance.



17
Celonis
There are three mandatory fields for an event: 
  Case identifier,
  Activity, 
  Timestamp



18
Celonis
A sequence of activities for a specific case is called a trace. Traces are used to automatically generate process models with varying levels of detail. Models that are simplified and show only the most common traces are made by filtering data.



19
Celonis
Event data frequently has all kinds of issues, for example quality. After data is cleaned up, process models are created automatically with process discovery techniques.



20
Celonis
Once we have the process models we would like to use, we can look at the event data for bottlenecks to improve performance or conformance.



21
Celonis
Machine learning techniques do not deal with event data well. When combined with process models, it becomes possible to generate insights like where bottlenecks may form in the future.



22
Celonis
Conformance testing is comparing process model behavior with ideal behavior



23
Celonis
Comparative process mining is comparing the same process or two different process to find out what we can improve. For example, in a large organizationship with different offices, the processes used in different offices can be compared to look for improvements



24
Celonis
Predictive process mining is trying to find out what is going to happen to take action



25
Celonis
Purchase to pay refers to the process of b2b purchasing where one company buys for example, equipment or inventory from a supplier. The purchase to pay process looks at the whole purchasing processs from making a purchase requisition and purchase order to paying the invoice.



26
Celonis
A process is a series of linked activities taken in order to achieve a particular goal.



27
Celonis
A process model describes a process and is base don the corresponding event data.



28
Celonis
An Event Log is a list of events realted to the process



29
Celonis
Process activities are actions that initiate or terminate a process, or take place during it.



30
Celonis
The Procurement process covers activities of requesting, purchasing, receiving, and paying for goods and services.

Celonis
Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs) Pros
  Easy to create and scalable
  Show paths, frequencies, and times
  Can be simplified easily using filters



2
Celonis
Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs) Cons
  Filtering needs to be done with the utmost care
  DFGs cannot capture concurrency



3
Celonis
When DFGs are used for a process that has concurrency (processes where there are activities that can be done simultaneously or in any order), they will generate graphs that look like they can loop infinitely. Different tools are recommended for visualizing concurrency.



4
Celonis
In this second chapter you got familiar with Directly-Follows Graphs. This model is a very powerful tool to visualize different steps in the as-is processes to get a whole picture and spot bottlenecks. 





5
Celonis
In general, 82% of cases tend to be described by 1% of all variants.



6
Celonis
Which of the statements are true for arc-based filtering on DFGs?
  [False] The final Directly- Follows Graph remains stable to any removal of activites. 
  [True] Hidden activities influence Directly-Follows frequency. 
  [True] Numbers do not need to add up after removing arcs.



7
Celonis
Concurrency means that no matter in what order a process is executed, even simultaneously, the end result will still be the same. 





8
Celonis
Pitri Nets are not used for visualization in Celonis. However, they underline a lot of discovery techniques and are used in the background.

The process of loading and preparing the data in Celonis is called Event Collection



11
Celonis
A common problem when cleaning data is the swapped day/month timestamp. The Europeans are very high handed about the fact that the Americans do MM/dd/yyyy and they do dd/MM/yyyy



12
Celonis
A data pool is the main structural element of the event collection. Data pools cluster data connections, data jobs, schedules, and data models.



13
Celonis
To analyze data, we must first create a process data model. 
  First we have to select the tables that need to be added to the model.
  Then we need to define the activity table
  Then we assign the three core columns
  Lastly, models need to be loaded.



14
Celonis
The activity table in celonis is the event table including the case ID, activity, and the timestamp.



15
Celonis
Many additional columns often includ case specific information, for example, the price of the purchase order. This can lead to data replication in the event log. This can be mitigated by saving multiple tables connected by foreign keys.



16
Celonis
Data is always arranged in a process data model that consists of an activity table, a case table, and an unlimited number of aditional tables with relations of the tables defined by the foreign keys.



17
Celonis
What are the challenges when extracting event data?
  Finding the data - ID the system that will be the source
  Extracting the data - setting up the pipeline
  Understand the data - know the schema/foreign key relationships



18
Celonis
What are the challenges when extracting event data?
  Quality problems - eg MM/DD/yyyy or DD/MM/yyyy
  Scalability - manually uploading data is too limited
  Data security and regulations



19
Celonis
An important aspect of that is the existence of common and widely-accepted standards, one of it being the data format for event logs.  XES is an XML-based format, and its name is an acronym for eXtensible Event Stream



20
Celonis
There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Deficiency - Events disappear from the data set due to missing representation in the flattened event log.



21
Celonis
There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Convergence - Unintentional duplication due to events referring to multiple objects being replicated




22
Celonis
There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Divergence - Wrong causal relation, 2 events being related to 2 different object not selected as the case.



23
Celonis
We distinguish between two features types. Static features do not change throughout a case and always remain the same. Examples could be Customer or Material Number. 



24
Celonis
We distinguish between two features types. Dynamic features are features that change over time and need to be updated throughout a case. Examples are counts of how often a certain activity already occurred in the process.



25
Celonis
When building a training set Static and Dynamic features need to be treated differently since they should not have the last state of a case but the state at a given time in the process.
