Celonis
A process is a series of linked activities taken in order to achieve a particular goal.



27
Celonis
A process model describes a process and is base don the corresponding event data.



28
Celonis
An Event Log is a list of events realted to the process



29
Celonis
Process activities are actions that initiate or terminate a process, or take place during it.

The Procurement process covers activities of requesting, purchasing, receiving, and paying for goods and services.

Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs) Pros
  Easy to create and scalable
  Show paths, frequencies, and times
  Can be simplified easily using filters



2
Celonis
Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs) Cons
  Filtering needs to be done with the utmost care
  DFGs cannot capture concurrency



3
Celonis
When DFGs are used for a process that has concurrency (processes where there are activities that can be done simultaneously or in any order), they will generate graphs that look like they can loop infinitely. Different tools are recommended for visualizing concurrency.



4
Celonis
In this second chapter you got familiar with Directly-Follows Graphs. This model is a very powerful tool to visualize different steps in the as-is processes to get a whole picture and spot bottlenecks.





5
Celonis
In general, 82% of cases tend to be described by 1% of all variants.



6
Celonis
Which of the statements are true for arc-based filtering on DFGs?
  [False] The final Directly- Follows Graph remains stable to any removal of activites.
  [True] Hidden activities influence Directly-Follows frequency.
  [True] Numbers do not need to add up after removing arcs.



7
Celonis
Concurrency means that no matter in what order a process is executed, even simultaneously, the end result will still be the same.





8
Celonis
Pitri Nets are not used for visualization in Celonis. However, they underline a lot of discovery techniques and are used in the background.

10
Celonis
The process of loading and preparing the data in Celonis is called Event Collection



11
Celonis
A common problem when cleaning data is the swapped day/month timestamp. The Europeans are very high handed about the fact that the Americans do MM/dd/yyyy and they do dd/MM/yyyy



12
Celonis
A data pool is the main structural element of the event collection. Data pools cluster data connections, data jobs, schedules, and data models.



13
Celonis
To analyze data, we must first create a process data model.
  First we have to select the tables that need to be added to the model.
  Then we need to define the activity table
  Then we assign the three core columns
  Lastly, models need to be loaded.



14
Celonis
The activity table in celonis is the event table including the case ID, activity, and the timestamp.



15
Celonis
Many additional columns often includ case specific information, for example, the price of the purchase order. This can lead to data replication in the event log. This can be mitigated by saving multiple tables connected by foreign keys.



16
Celonis
Data is always arranged in a process data model that consists of an activity table, a case table, and an unlimited number of aditional tables with relations of the tables defined by the foreign keys.



17
Celonis
What are the challenges when extracting event data?
  Finding the data - ID the system that will be the source
  Extracting the data - setting up the pipeline
  Understand the data - know the schema/foreign key relationships



18
Celonis
What are the challenges when extracting event data?
  Quality problems - eg MM/DD/yyyy or DD/MM/yyyy
  Scalability - manually uploading data is too limited
  Data security and regulations



19
Celonis
An important aspect of that is the existence of common and widely-accepted standards, one of it being the data format for event logs.  XES is an XML-based format, and its name is an acronym for eXtensible Event Stream



20
Celonis
There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Deficiency - Events disappear from the data set due to missing representation in the flattened event log.



21
Celonis
There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Convergence - Unintentional duplication due to events referring to multiple objects being replicated




22
Celonis
There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Divergence - Wrong causal relation, 2 events being related to 2 different object not selected as the case.



23
Celonis
We distinguish between two features types. Static features do not change throughout a case and always remain the same. Examples could be Customer or Material Number.



24
Celonis
We distinguish between two features types. Dynamic features are features that change over time and need to be updated throughout a case. Examples are counts of how often a certain activity already occurred in the process.



25
Celonis
When building a training set Static and Dynamic features need to be treated differently since they should not have the last state of a case but the state at a given time in the process.



26
Celonis
If you're looking for operational friction, focus on the cases that are infrequent and that you don't want to happen.



27
Celonis
Machine Learning can be applied after data is imported, cleaned, analyized, and reorganized into feature sets. This is one of the last things that Celonis can do, and it's unlikely that our customers will get to it.



28
Celonis
Machine Learning in Celonis is demonstrated to help predict with real time data which cases are likely to be delayed so that corrective action can be taken. Again, this is probably beyond the capacity of Hawaii companies to use.



29
General 
The Pareto principle or "80-20 rule" stating that 80% of outcomes are due to 20% of causes was named in honour of Pareto, but the concepts are distinct, and only Pareto distributions with shape value (α) of log45 ≈ 1.16 precisely reflect it. Empirical observation has shown that this 80-20 distribution fits a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena[5] and human activities.[6][7] the principle originally applied to describing the distribution of wealth in a society, fitting the trend that a large portion of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population



30
Celonis
Action Flows allows users to deploy any of around 10k pre-built automations for a number of existing connected services.




1
Celonis
What does the Pareto distribution tell us in relation to processes?
  80% of the cases, is explained by only 20% of variants. 
  Infrequent variants often correspond to problems in the process.
