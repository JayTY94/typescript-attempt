On a regular Windows machine, only one user can run. But on a Windows server machine, multiple users can run simultaneously.

Licenses are consumed as soon as a machine is connected to Orchestrator, no matter the number of users running on it.





2
UiPath
The process, the user and the machine template need to be mapped to the folder in order to run an unattended job. The package is a tenant entity, therefore not mapped to the folder.



3
UiPath
A point to remember right from the beginning is that unattended robots do not exist as independent entities. As we saw in the previous lesson, they are a combination between a user or robot account and a machine. From this perspective, a better name for a robot is execution slot.



4
UiPath
One important mention here before going further. The ability to allocate more than one runtime and to execute several processes on the same machine is applicable only for Windows Server machines.





5
UiPath
Which of the following folder entities can be configured to be accessed/executed only by a certain unattended robot?

Asset
Trigger
Job
not Queue

Which of the following entities need to be mapped to the folder in order to run an unattended job?
User or Robot
Process

Not Queues
Not Package

UiPath
[FALSE] When a user is being imported from Active Directory, the automation robot creation can be configured only for the attended robot, but not for the unattended one.

	• UiPath Robot
The execution host that runs processes designed in UiPath Studio



10
UiPath
	• Robot (Orchestrator object)
Orchestrator object used to define the capabilities and privileges of a UiPath Robot such as access to folder resources, machine login credentials, etc. In this guide, it is often referred to as a robot, robot object, robot entity.



11
UiPath
	• Machine (host machine)
The physical or virtual machine used to host and deploy a UiPath Robot. In this guide, it is referred to as the host machine, workstation, or server, to differentiate it from the machine object in Orchestrator



12
UiPath
	• Machine (Orchestrator object)
Orchestrator object that works as an API key generator, authorizing the usage of a UiPath Robot on a host machine. For unattended use cases, it also allows administrators to configure the execution capacity for the associated host machine(s). For more information, see About Machines



13
UiPath
The article "About Robots in Orchestrator" in the UiPath documentation is great.



14
UiPath
You cannot typically start or trigger processes in Orchestrator on attended robots, and they cannot run under a locked screen. They can only be started from UiPath assistant or the Command Prompt.



15
UiPath
An exception to the rule that attended automations must be launched from UiPath assistant or the Command prompt is process debugging, where users, generally RPA developers, can launch processes from Orchestrator on attended robots. This can be done via personal workspaces which allow launching processes in Orchestrator on attended robots by using the machine template automatically generated by virtue of being a personal workspace owner. Read more about personal workspaces.



16
UiPath
By default, the start of the Robot Service is triggered by user sign-in when  the service is set to run at login time. If it's not set to run at login time, opening the UiPath Assistant starts it automatically.



17
UiPath
Installing the Robot from UiPathStudioSetup.exe deploys the User Mode Robot by default. It can also be installed from UiPathStudio.msi or the command prompt.

ReadMe is an easy-to-use tool to help you build out documentation! Each documentation site that you publish on ReadMe is a project. Within a project there is space for documentation, interactive API reference guides, a changelog, and many more features. Each project within your account is published separately.

UiPath uses ReadMe for their documentation

Security+
Replay Attack

Useful information is transmitted over the network
  A crafty hacker will take advantage of this
Need access to raw network data
  Network tap, ARP poisoning, Malware on the victim computer



20
Security+
Replay Attack

Information gathered from network can help attacker
  Replay the data to appear as someone else
This is not an on-path attack
  The actual replay doesn't require the original workstation



21
Security+
Header manipulation
Information gathering
  Wireshark, Kismet
Exploits
  Cross-site scripting
Modify headers
  Tamper, firesheep, scapy
Modify cookies
  Cookies Manager+ (Firefox add-on)

Cross-site requests are common and legitimate
  You visit Professormesser.com
  Your browser loads text from the ProfessorMesser.com web server
  Your browser loads a video from youtube
  Your browser loads pictures form Instagram
HTML on ProfessorMesser.com directs requests from your browser
  this is normal and expected
  Most of these are unauthenticated requests



23
Security+
Cross-site request forgery
One-click attack, session riding
  XSRF, CSRF (sea surf)
Takes advantage of the trust that a web application has for the user
  The web stie trusts your browser
  requests are made without your consent or knowledge
  Attacker posts a facebook status on your account
Significant web application development oversight
  Usually a cryptographic token used to prevent forgery



24
Security+
Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
Attacker finds a vulnerable web application
  Sends requests to a web server
  web server performs the request on behalf of the attacker
Caused by bad programming
  Never trust the user input
  Server should validate the input and the responses
  These are rare but critical vulnerabilities



25
Security+
Shimming is filling a space between two objects.
Windows has its own shim
  Backwards compatibility with previous windows versions
  Applications Compatibility Shim Cache
Malware authors write their own shims
  Get around security like UAC
Jan 2015 Microsoft vulnerability
  Elevated privilege



26
Security+
An SSL stripping or HTTP downgrade attack combines an on-path attack with a downgrade attack
Attacker must sit in the middle of the conversation
  Must modify data between the victim and web server
  Proxy server, ARP spoofing, rogue WIfi hotspt, etc
Victim does not see any significant problem
  Except browser pages are not encrypted (http vs https)
This is a client and server problem



27

Raceconditions can cause big problems
Jan 2004 Mars rover "Spirit"
  Reboot when problem identified
  Problem was with the file system, but fs corrupted in boot process
  Reboot loop was result
GE - Energy Management System
  Three power lines failed at teh same time, race condition delayed alerts
  Caused Northeast Blackout of 2003

Commercial off-the-shelf or commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) products are packaged or canned (ready-made) hardware or software, which are adapted aftermarket to the needs of the purchasing organization, rather than the commissioning of custom-made, or bespoke, solutions. A related term, Mil-COTS, refers to COTS products for use by the U.S. military.
