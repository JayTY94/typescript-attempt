Data is always arranged in a process data model that consists of an activity table, a case table, and an unlimited number of aditional tables with relations of the tables defined by the foreign keys.

What are the challenges when extracting event data?
  Finding the data - ID the system that will be the source
  Extracting the data - setting up the pipeline
  Understand the data - know the schema/foreign key relationships

What are the challenges when extracting event data?
  Quality problems - eg MM/DD/yyyy or DD/MM/yyyy
  Scalability - manually uploading data is too limited
  Data security and regulations

An important aspect of that is the existence of common and widely-accepted standards, one of it being the data format for event logs.  XES is an XML-based format, and its name is an acronym for eXtensible Event Stream

There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Deficiency - Events disappear from the data set due to missing representation in the flattened event log.

There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Convergence - Unintentional duplication due to events referring to multiple objects being replicated

There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Divergence - Wrong causal relation, 2 events being related to 2 different object not selected as the case.

We distinguish between two features types. Static features do not change throughout a case and always remain the same. Examples could be Customer or Material Number.



24
Celonis
We distinguish between two features types. Dynamic features are features that change over time and need to be updated throughout a case. Examples are counts of how often a certain activity already occurred in the process.



25
Celonis
When building a training set Static and Dynamic features need to be treated differently since they should not have the last state of a case but the state at a given time in the process.

If you're looking for operational friction, focus on the cases that are infrequent and that you don't want to happen.

Machine Learning can be applied after data is imported, cleaned, analyized, and reorganized into feature sets. This is one of the last things that Celonis can do, and it's unlikely that our customers will get to it.

Machine Learning in Celonis is demonstrated to help predict with real time data which cases are likely to be delayed so that corrective action can be taken. Again, this is probably beyond the capacity of Hawaii companies to use.

General 
The Pareto principle or "80-20 rule" stating that 80% of outcomes are due to 20% of causes was named in honour of Pareto, but the concepts are distinct, and only Pareto distributions with shape value (α) of log45 ≈ 1.16 precisely reflect it. Empirical observation has shown that this 80-20 distribution fits a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena[5] and human activities.[6][7] the principle originally applied to describing the distribution of wealth in a society, fitting the trend that a large portion of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population

Action Flows allows users to deploy any of around 10k pre-built automations for a number of existing connected services.
