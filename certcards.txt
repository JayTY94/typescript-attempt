Malware authors will also use websites to embed their links and have pop-up messages to entice you to click those links and download the software so that they can then run that malware on your local computer. They might also use these web pages to automatically download software to your computer and then encourage you to run that software using a technique called a drive-by download.

A virus is malware that can reproduce itself, but one of the unique characteristics of a virus is that it needs you– the end user– to click on or launch that application to start the virus replication process. This is something that differentiates a virus from a worm.



6
Security +
If the virus is never saving itself to the storage drive, then it may be able to evade the antivirus software. Instead of existing as a file that might execute, the fileless virus operates solely in the memory of the computer. Once it’s started, all of the operations happen inside of RAM, and nothing is ever written to the storage drive on your system.

Crypto-malware uses cryptography to be able to encrypt all of your personal information and make it so that none of that information can be decrypted unless you have the proper key. The way that you obtain that key is that you send the attackers money or Bitcoin

One type of software that’s commonly downloaded by this Trojan horse software is a PUP. This is a potentially unwanted program. This may not be malicious software, but it could be undesirable and may cause performance problems on your computer.

A type of software that attackers might install as part of the back door is a Remote Access Trojan, or a RAT. You might also hear this referred to as a Remote Administration Tool. This is a remote access tool that gives a third party access to your computer to have nearly complete control over the operating system.



10

A common characteristic of a rootkit is, instead of modifying files in your operating system, it’s modifying files in the kernel of the operating system.

Spyware is a bit more malicious than adware, because it’s trying to find out things about you or to gather information about you. Spyware might be looking to see where you visit on the internet. It might be trying to identify personal information about you so that it can use that for identity theft,

The bot malware on a computer is working along with other computers that are infected with the same bot malware to create a botnet. This botnet is controlled through a Command and Control server or C&C server. The C&C server is responsible for sending out commands.

It’s difficult to identify if a logic bomb has been placed in a system because it doesn’t follow any known signature. It’s not possible for antivirus or anti-malware to automatically recognize that a logic bomb may exist. It also might be difficult to gather evidence after the fact, because many logic bombs will delete themselves once they’ve executed.

A spraying attack avoids the results of a locked account for trying the wrong password over and over again without success. Instead, a spraying attack is going to try to use some very common passwords and only try a few of them before moving on.

With Brute Force attacks,  it’s common for the attacker to have already downloaded the password file. They can then perform an offline attack of those hashes where they can programmatically step through every possible combination and do it very quickly on their local machine.



16

A salt is a little bit of extra random data added to the password before it is hashed. This means that if two users happen to be using exactly the same password, the hash that’s stored in the password table is going to be different between the two even though their password is exactly the same because a different type of random salt was added to each one of those user’s passwords.

This looks like a perfectly normal USB cable. We would use it to plug into our computer and charge our systems, except it has some additional electronics inside. It could, in fact, tell your operating system that it is a HID, or a human interface device.

A good example of poisoned training data occurred with a Microsoft AI chatter bot named Tay. Tay stands for thinking about you. And Tay was added to Twitter on March 23, 2016. It was able to hold conversations with Twitter users. But Microsoft didn’t add any type of anti-offensive behavior or anti-offensive learning algorithms to Tay.

So once Tay started interacting with other users and other users realized that they could poison the learning process, they turned into a racist, sexist, and inappropriate bot.

 A hash collision is when you have two very different types of plain text, but both of those plain text create exactly the same hash. This is something that should never happen.

And if we’re able to find a hash collision, we may be able to take advantage of this inconsistency in the hash algorithm. With the hash collision, the attacker spends their time finding that other type of plain text that matches that hash.

The operating system itself may have safeguards in place to prevent someone from taking advantage of a privileged escalation.

One of these safeguards is called data execution prevention it’s a way to only allow applications to run in certain areas of memory where that particular function is allowed. Vulnerabilities that try to run an application from the data section of memory would be blocked using data execution prevention.

Non-persistent (reflected) XSS attack
  Web site allows scripts to run in user input, commonly search box
  Attacker emailsa link that takes advantage of this vulnerability
    Runs a script that sends credentials/session IDs/cookies to attacker
  Script embedded in URL executes in victim's browser

Persistent (stored) Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  Attacker posts a message to a social network
    Includes malicious payload
  It is not "persistent"
    Everyone who sees the post gets the payload
  Payload is some kind of script, probably javascript.

A buffer overflow attack occurs when one section of memory is able to overwrite a different section of memory. This type of overriding or spilling over of memory should not occur, and if someone is able to replicate that in a way that’s controllable, they may be able to gain access to the system or cause an application to perform the way that they would like. 



28
Security +
A good buffer overflow for an attacker is one that they can both replicate and one that they can control. This is not a simple exploit to find, and it’s not an easy exploit for an attacker to take advantage of. It’s very difficult to find some software that would allow this buffer overflow, and then it’s very difficult to have a buffer overflow that might not cause the system to become unstable or to crash.
