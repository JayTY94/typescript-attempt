24
Automation Hub
The automation initiatives are at the core of any RPA program. In Automation Hub they are called automation ideas, because this is how they originate. And even as they advance through their lifecycle by being assessed, qualified and finally implemented, we continue calling them automation ideas.



25
Automation Hub
Reusable Components

Simply put, these are reusable parts of the automations being developed, such as custom activities, templates or connectors. Having these available in a single place drives effectiveness, by avoiding duplication of efforts, as well as code quality. That's exactly what Automation Hub offers through the component gallery feature.





26
Automation Hub
People

Automation Hub is the place for all the employees that want to contribute to and benefit from automation. They submit ideas and components, they collaborate in the lifecycle of an automation, or simply engage with the other users or ideas that they are interested in.

On-Path browser attack
What if the middleman was on the same computer as the victim?
	Malware/Trojan does all of the proxy work
	Formerly known as man-in-the-browser
Huge advantages for the attackers
	Relatively easy to proxy encrypted traffic
	Everything looks normal to the victim



13
Security+
Lan switching
Forward or drop frames
	Based on the destination MAC address
Switches gather a constantly updating list of MAC addresses
	Builds the list based on teh source MAC address of incoming traffic
	These age out periodically, often in 5 minutes
Maintain a loop-free environment
	Using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)



14
Security+
MAC flooding
The MAC table on a switch is only so big
Attacker starts sending traffic with different MAC addressses
	Forces out he legitimate MAC addresses
The table fills up
	Switch begins flooding server traffic to all interfaces



15
Security+
Mac flooding
Effectively turns a switch into a hub
	All traffic is transmitted to all interfaces
	No interruption in traffic flows
Attacker can easily capture all network traffic
Flooding can be restricted in the switch's port security setting



16
Security+
MAC cloning/MAC spoofing
An attacker changes their MAC address to match the MAC of an existing device
This allows them to circumvent filters
	Wireless or wired MAC filters
	Identify a valid MAC address and copy it




17
Security+
MAC cloning/MAC spoofing
Create a Denial of Service (DoS)
	Intercept and thus deny all communication the legitimate device receives
Easily manipulated through software
	Usually a device driver option

In computing, Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standard application programming interface (API) for accessing database management systems (DBMS). The designers of ODBC aimed to make it independent of database systems and operating systems.



29
UiPath
At the start of each Process Mining implementation, we need to load the data. UiPath Process Mining supports different methods to load the data. The most common ones are establishing an ODBC connection, reading from a flat file (csv, xlsx), or making a direct connection with SAP.

URL Hijacking
Making money from your mistakes (typos)
	Just directing you to a page that has adds
Might to go to a phishing site
	Looks like the real site; please login
Might also infect with a drive-by download

Security +
URL Hijacking
Might sell the badly spelled domain to the owner of the site they're attacking
Might also redirect to a compnetitor
	Not as common and has legal issues




7
Security +
Domain repulation
Infected web servers are noticed by search engines
	Your domain can be flagged or removed
Will put a big "This site contains malware" page up before directing people to your site
Malware might be removed quickly, but recovery of reputation takes much longer.
