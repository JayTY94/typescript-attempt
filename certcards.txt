Normalization is a term used by database professionals for a schema design process that minimizes data duplication and enforces data integrity.

Principle of Normalization 1 of 4
Separate each entity into its own table



24

Principle of Normalization 2 of 4
Separate each discrete attribute



25
Azure Data Fundamentals
Principle of Normalization 3 of 4
Uniquely identify each entity instance (row) using a primary key.



26
Azure Data Fundamentals
Principle of Normalization 4 of 4
Use foreign key columns to link related entities.

The four main DML statements are:

Statement	Description
SELECT	Read rows from a table
INSERT	Insert new rows into a table
UPDATE	Modify data in existing rows
DELETE	Delete existing rows

A view is a virtual table based on the results of a SELECT query. You an think of a view as a window on specified rows in one or more underlying tables. You can query the view and filter the data in much the same way as a table

A stored procedure defines SQL statements that can be run on command. Stored procedures are used to encapsulate programmatic logic in a database for actions that applications need to perform when working with data.

WHen you create an index in a database, you specify a column from the table, and the index contains a copy of this data in a sorted order, with pointers to the corresponding rows in the table. When the user runs a query that specifies this column in the WHERE clause, the database management system can use this index to fetch the data more quickly than if it had to scan the entire table row by row.

You can create many indexes on a table. However, Indexes aren't free. An index consumes storage space, and each time you insert, update, and delte data in a table, teh indexes for that table must be maintained.

SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) - A virtual machine running in Azure with an installation of SQL Server. The use of a VM makes this option an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solution that virtualizes hardware infrastructure for compute, storage, and networking in Azure; making it a great option for "lift and shift" migration of existing on-premises SQL Server installations to the cloud.

Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure SQL Managed Instance - A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) option that provides near-100% compatibility with on-premises SQL Server instances while abstracting the underlying hardware and operating system. The service includes automated software update management, backups, and other maintenance tasks, reducing the administrative burden of supporting a database server instance.

Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure SQL Database - A fully managed, highly scalable PaaS database service that is designed for the cloud. This service includes the core database-level capabilities of on-premises SQL Server, and is a good option when you need to create a new application in the cloud.

Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure SQL Edge - A SQL engine that is optimized for Internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios that need to work with streaming time-series data.




6
Azure Data Fundamentals
Managed instances depend on other Azure services such as Azure Storage for backups, Azure Event Hubs for telemetry, Azure Active Directory for authentication, Azure Key Vault for Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and a couple of Azure platform services that provide security and supportability features. The managed instances make connections to these services.

Azure SQL Database is often used for:

Modern cloud applications that need to use the latest stable SQL Server features.
Applications that require high availability.
Systems with a variable load that need the database server to scale up and down quickly.

Elastic Pool
This option is similar to Single Database, except that by default multiple databases can share the same resources, such as memory, data storage space, and processing power through multiple-tenancy. The resources are referred to as a pool. This model is useful if you have databases with resource requirements that vary over time, and can help you to reduce costs.

PostgreSQL is a hybrid relational-object database. You can store data in relational tables, but a PostgreSQL database also enables you to store custom data types, with their own non-relational properties
