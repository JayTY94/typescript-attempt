In an sandbox, I have manually entered data into the Azure Table using the storage browser interface. In a real scenario, application developers can use the Azure Storage Table API to build applications that read and write values to tables, making it a cost effective and scalable solution for NoSQL storage.

What are the elements of an Azure Table Storage key?
Partition key and row key
The partition key identifies the partition in which a row is located, and the rows in each partition are stored in row key order.

What should you do to an existing Azure Storage account in order to support a data lake for Azure Synapse Analytics?
Upgrade the account to enable hierarchical namespace and create a blob container
Enabling a hierarchical namespace adds support for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2, which can be used by Synapse Analytics.

Cosmos DB uses indexes and partitioning to provide fast read and write performance and can scale to massive volumes of data. You can enable multi-region writes, adding the Azure regions of your choice to your Cosmos DB account so that globally distributed users can each work with data in their local replica.

Microsoft uses Cosmos DB for its own e-commerce platforms that run as part of Windows Store and Xbox Live. It's also used in the retail industry for storing catalog data and for event sourcing in order processing pipelines.

Azure Data Fundamentals
Azure Cosmos DB is commonly used within web and mobile applications, and it is well suited for modeling social interactions, integrating with third-party services, and for building rich personalized experiences. The Cosmos DB SDKs can be used to build rich iOS and Android applications using the popular Xamarin framework.



17
Azure Data Fundamentals
When you provision a new Cosmos DB instance, you select the API that you want to use. The choice of API depends on many factors including the type of data to be stored, the need to support existing applications, and the API skills of the developers who will work with the data store.

Azure Data Fundamentals
The native API in Cosmos DB manages data in JSON document format, and despite being a NoSQL data storage solution, uses SQL syntax to work with the data.

MongoDB Query Language (MQL) uses a compact, object-oriented syntax in which developers use objects to call methods. For example, the following query uses the find method to query the producs collection in the db object:

  db.products.find({id: 123})

Azure Data Fundamentals
The Table API is used to work with data in key-value tables, similar to Azure Table Storage. The Azure Cosmos DB Table API offers greater scalability and performance than Azure Table Storage.





21
Azure Data Fundamentals
The Cassandra API is compatible with Apache Cassandra, which is a popular open source database that uses a column-family storage structure. Column families are tables, similar to those in a relational database, with the exception that it's not mandatory for every row to have the same columns.





22
Azure Data Fundamentals
The Gremlin API is used with data in a graph structure; in which entities are defined as vertices that form nodes in connected graph. Nodes are connected by edges that represent relationships, like this:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-non-relational-data-stores-azure/3-cosmos-db-apis

The example in the image shows two kinds of vertex (employee and department) and edges that connect them (employee "Ben" reports to employee "Sue", and both employees work in the "Hardware" department).

Which API should you use to store and query JSON documents in Azure Cosmos DB?

Core (SQL) API is designed to store and query JSON documents.



24
Azure Data Fundamentals
Which Azure Cosmos DB API should you use to work with data in which entities and their relationships to one another are represented in a graph using vertices and edges?

The Gremlin API is used to manage a network of nodes (vertices) and the relationships between them (edges).



25
Azure Data Fundamentals
How can you enable globally distributed users to work with their own local replica of a Cosmos DB database?

Enable multi-region writes and add the regions where you have users. You can enable multi-region writes in the regions where you want users to work with the data.



26
Azure Data Fundamentals
A conventional data warehousing solution typically involves copying data from transactional data stores into a relational database with a schema that's optimized for querying and building multidimensional models.



27
Azure Data Fundamentals
Big Data processing solutions, are used with large volumes of data in multiple formats, which is batch loaded or captured in real-time streams and stored in a data lake from which distributed processing engines like Apache Spark are used to process it.
