Azure Cosmos DB is commonly used within web and mobile applications, and it is well suited for modeling social interactions, integrating with third-party services, and for building rich personalized experiences. The Cosmos DB SDKs can be used to build rich iOS and Android applications using the popular Xamarin framework.

When you provision a new Cosmos DB instance, you select the API that you want to use. The choice of API depends on many factors including the type of data to be stored, the need to support existing applications, and the API skills of the developers who will work with the data store.

Azure Data Fundamentals
The native API in Cosmos DB manages data in JSON document format, and despite being a NoSQL data storage solution, uses SQL syntax to work with the data.

MongoDB Query Language (MQL) uses a compact, object-oriented syntax in which developers use objects to call methods. For example, the following query uses the find method to query the producs collection in the db object:

  db.products.find({id: 123})

The Table API is used to work with data in key-value tables, similar to Azure Table Storage. The Azure Cosmos DB Table API offers greater scalability and performance than Azure Table Storage.





21
Azure Data Fundamentals
The Cassandra API is compatible with Apache Cassandra, which is a popular open source database that uses a column-family storage structure. Column families are tables, similar to those in a relational database, with the exception that it's not mandatory for every row to have the same columns.





22
Azure Data Fundamentals
The Gremlin API is used with data in a graph structure; in which entities are defined as vertices that form nodes in connected graph. Nodes are connected by edges that represent relationships, like this:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-non-relational-data-stores-azure/3-cosmos-db-apis

The example in the image shows two kinds of vertex (employee and department) and edges that connect them (employee "Ben" reports to employee "Sue", and both employees work in the "Hardware" department).

Which API should you use to store and query JSON documents in Azure Cosmos DB?

Core (SQL) API is designed to store and query JSON documents.



24
Azure Data Fundamentals
Which Azure Cosmos DB API should you use to work with data in which entities and their relationships to one another are represented in a graph using vertices and edges?

The Gremlin API is used to manage a network of nodes (vertices) and the relationships between them (edges).



25
Azure Data Fundamentals
How can you enable globally distributed users to work with their own local replica of a Cosmos DB database?

Enable multi-region writes and add the regions where you have users. You can enable multi-region writes in the regions where you want users to work with the data.



26
Azure Data Fundamentals
A conventional data warehousing solution typically involves copying data from transactional data stores into a relational database with a schema that's optimized for querying and building multidimensional models.



27
Azure Data Fundamentals
Big Data processing solutions, are used with large volumes of data in multiple formats, which is batch loaded or captured in real-time streams and stored in a data lake from which distributed processing engines like Apache Spark are used to process it.



28
Azure Data Fundamentals
Analytical data model - while data analysts and data scientists can work with the data directly in the analytical data store, it's common to create one or more data models that pre-aggregate the data to make it easier to produce reports, dashboards, and interactive visualizations. Often these data models are described as cubes, in which numeric data values are aggregated across one or more dimesniosn (for example, to determine total sales by product an dregion).

On Azure, large-scale data ingestion is best implemented by creating pipelines that orchestrate ETL processes. You can create and run pipelines using Azure Data Factory, or you can use the same pipeline engine in Azure Synapse Analytics

Pipelines consist of one or more activities that operate on data. An input dataset provides the source data, and activities can be defined as a data flow that incrementally manipulates the data until an output dataset is produced. Pipelines use linked services to load and process data â€“ enabling you to use the right technology for each step of the workflow

Azure Data Fundamentals
A fact and dimension table schema is called a star schema; though it's often extended into a snowflake schema by adding additional tables related to the dimension tables to represent dimensional hierarchies (for example, product might be related to product categories)


3
Azure Data Fundamentals
Technologies like Spark or Hadoop are often used to process queries on the stored files and return data for reporting and analytics. These systems often apply a schema-on-read approach to define tabular schemas on semi-structured data files at the point where the data is read for analysis, without applying constraints when it's stored

Databricks provides an interactive user interface through which the system can be managed and data can be explored in interactive notebooks.
