The other outcome of the digitization process is all the text from the document, stored in a string variable.





2
UiPath Document Understanding
Classification is done through the Classify Document Scope and it's performed by classifiers.

Basically, the document text and object model resulted in the digitization steps are sent to the Classifiers, which report what types they recognize within the incoming file.

What happens if a document is not classified correctly...

  1. If training step is implemented, the classifier will get more accurate over time.

What happens if a document is not classified correctly...

  2. The robot tries to extract values for the fields defined in the Taxonomy for classification made

What happens if a document is not classified correctly...

  3. You can correct the classification in the Validation Station.

Why do you need to map the fields in hte Extractor configuration when using the MS Extractor?

  Some extractors have their own Taxonomy, which is why you need to map the fields - this is the case for the ML Extractor.



7
UiPath Document Understanding
Take this scenario: you need to extract data from medical records, but all the documents come in a single PDF file.  Based on a list of classification results, you loop through each and perform data extraction.

What arguments do you add in the data extraction scope? Select all that apply.
  Taxaonomy
  Document path
  Document Object Model
  Document Text
  Validated Classification Result

UiPath Document Understanding
Select all of the extractors you would use to extract data from a semi-structured document.

  The Regex extractor
  The Machine Learning Extractor
  NOT
  The Form Extractor
  The Intelligent Form Extractor

UiPath Document Understanding
Select all the actions that you can perform inside the Validation Station
  Change extracted value
  Add an additional value
  Add rows and cell values to a Table
  Correct classification results





10
UiPath Document Understanding
What are the mandatory steps for processing a document with the intelligent OCR activities.
  Digitize Document
  Create the Taxonomy
  Loading the Taxonomy
  Data Extraction with at least one Extractor



11
UiPath Document Understanding
[true] You can extract data from rotated or skewed documents.



12
UiPath Document Understanding
The Configure Classifiers Wizard accessed via the Train Classifiers Scope allows you to choose which classifiers are trained for each document type.

A DataTable is an in-memory representation of a single database table which has collection of rows and columns where as a DataSet is an in-memory representation of a database-like structure which has a collection of DataTables.



14
UiPath Document Understanding
The Train Classifiers Scope empowers the closing of the feedback loop to any classification algorithm capable of learning. Drag and drop your classifier trainers within this Scope activity and enable them using the Configure Classifiers wizard to ensure that the information validated by humans through the Classification Station or Validation Station is used by your classifiers to improve their own performance.





15
UiPath Document Understanding
The Machine Learning Extractor leverages the power of AI and Machine Learning to identify information in structured or semi-structured documents by either using one of  UiPath's public data extraction services or by calling custom trained Machine Learning models that you can build and host in AI Fabric. This activity is part of the UiPath.DocumentUnderstanding.ML.Activities package.



16
UiPath Document Understanding
You can also enable human validation through Long-Running Workflows, optimizing human-robot collaboration. The Create Document Validation Action and the Wait for Document Validation Action and Resume activities enable this scenario.

Asana
Projects are stored in teams (and Portfolios) to track all actionable steps, information, and communications towards achieving a goal, initiative, or objective.




21
Asana
Tasks are stored in projects and make it clear who's responsible for what by when. Tasks store all files, messages, and instructions related to it so they're easy to find in one place.




22
Asana
Portfolios store groups of projects. You can use them to see all the projects and status updates towards an initiative or objective in one place.

Data structures in which this data is organized often represents entities that are important to an organization (such as customers, products, sales orders, and so on).



25
Azure Data Fundamentals
One common format for semi-structured data is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). The example below shows a pair of JSON documents that represent customer information.




26
Azure Data Fundamentals
Structured data is data that adheres to a fixed schema, so all of the data has the same fields or properties. Most commonly, the schema for structured data entities is tabular - in other words, the data is represented in one or more tables that consist of rows to represent each instance of a data entity, and columns to represent attributes of the entity.
