UiPath
It is a version of a package that's been allocated to a certain folder.

Given that most processes use a queue, asset, or storage bucket, the Package Requirements tab, for when adding a new process, makes it easy to identify which entities your package is using and if they are missing from your folder.



18
UiPath
A job represents the execution of a process on a UiPath Robot. You can launch the execution of a job in either attended or unattended mode. You cannot launch a job from Orchestrator on attended robots, unless for debugging purposes using personal workspaces, and they cannot run under a locked screen. 



19
UiPath
Attended and unattended robots send a heartbeat to Orchestrator every 30 seconds. This signals to Orchestrator that the connection is working.





20
UiPath
Both human users and robots are uniquely identified with users in Orchestrator.





21
UiPath
Machine (Orchestrator entity)
–
These are Orchestrator entities corresponding to the workstations where human users and robots work. Using API keys, they enable the connection between the physical machines and Orchestrator.



22
UiPath
License
–
The right to use Studio and/or Robots, both attended and unattended, is done through licenses. Licenses exist at tenant level, from where they get distributed to users, and consumed when the machines connect to Orchestrator.



23
UiPath
Webhook
–
Webhooks facilitate the communication between Orchestrator and other applications at API level. These are mapped at tenant level, which means they cannot be differentiated between folders and will provide information for the entire tenant.



24
UiPath
Trigger
–
Triggers enable the execution of jobs in a structured manner. There are two types of triggers:

Time triggers: with these, you can schedule the recurrent execution of a process.
Queue triggers: these enable the execution of a process based on the new items added to a queue.



25
UiPath
In order to access and run automations, both human users and robots need roles.



26
UiPath
To successfully run a job with an unattended robot:

Under Robot Setup, the Unattended Robot is enabled for the user or robot account.
The workstation on which the unattended robot runs is connected to Orchestrator using a machine template.
The user or robot and the machine template are in the same folder as the process you want to run.
Unattended runtimes (licenses) are available on the tenant.



27
UiPath
Robot accounts have to be created in Automation Cloud, and they behave like user accounts regarding permissions. The only differences compared to user accounts are: 

Robot accounts are not allowed to have any interactive-related process configuration.
No email address is required to create a robot account.



28
UiPath
To simplify the attended and unattended robot creation, as well as the license provisioning, the automation robot creation can be enabled at user level, for both attended and unattended robots, and at group level for attended robots.

Basically, you enable the Attended Robot or Unattended Robot toggle at the account or group level, configure the various settings (robot execution settings, machine login credentials, if applicable), and a floating robot with those attributes is created.



29
UiPath
There are two types of machines in Orchestrator:

Machine templates: this allows the connection to multiple workstations with a single API key.




30
UiPath
There are two types of machines in Orchestrator:
Standard machines: this allows the connection between Orchestrator and a single machine. This is suitable for scenarios in which robots need to run on specific machines.


1
UiPath
On a regular Windows machine, only one user can run. But on a Windows server machine, multiple users can run simultaneously.

Licenses are consumed as soon as a machine is connected to Orchestrator, no matter the number of users running on it.





2
UiPath
The process, the user and the machine template need to be mapped to the folder in order to run an unattended job. The package is a tenant entity, therefore not mapped to the folder.



3
UiPath
A point to remember right from the beginning is that unattended robots do not exist as independent entities. As we saw in the previous lesson, they are a combination between a user or robot account and a machine. From this perspective, a better name for a robot is execution slot.



4
UiPath
One important mention here before going further. The ability to allocate more than one runtime and to execute several processes on the same machine is applicable only for Windows Server machines.





5
UiPath
Which of the following folder entities can be configured to be accessed/executed only by a certain unattended robot?

Asset
Trigger
Job
not Queue



6
UiPath
Which of the following folder entities can be configured to be accessed/executed only by a certain unattended robot?
Trigger
Job
Asset




7
UiPath
Which of the following entities need to be mapped to the folder in order to run an unattended job?
User or Robot
Process 
Machine Template
Not Queues
Not Package



8
UiPath
[FALSE] When a user is being imported from Active Directory, the automation robot creation can be configured only for the attended robot, but not for the unattended one.

UiPath
	• UiPath Robot
The execution host that runs processes designed in UiPath Studio



10
UiPath
	• Robot (Orchestrator object)
Orchestrator object used to define the capabilities and privileges of a UiPath Robot such as access to folder resources, machine login credentials, etc. In this guide, it is often referred to as a robot, robot object, robot entity.



11
UiPath
	• Machine (host machine)
The physical or virtual machine used to host and deploy a UiPath Robot. In this guide, it is referred to as the host machine, workstation, or server, to differentiate it from the machine object in Orchestrator



12
UiPath
	• Machine (Orchestrator object)
Orchestrator object that works as an API key generator, authorizing the usage of a UiPath Robot on a host machine. For unattended use cases, it also allows administrators to configure the execution capacity for the associated host machine(s). For more information, see About Machines



13
UiPath
The article "About Robots in Orchestrator" in the UiPath documentation is great.



14
UiPath
You cannot typically start or trigger processes in Orchestrator on attended robots, and they cannot run under a locked screen. They can only be started from UiPath assistant or the Command Prompt.



15
UiPath
An exception to the rule that attended automations must be launched from UiPath assistant or the Command prompt is process debugging, where users, generally RPA developers, can launch processes from Orchestrator on attended robots. This can be done via personal workspaces which allow launching processes in Orchestrator on attended robots by using the machine template automatically generated by virtue of being a personal workspace owner. Read more about personal workspaces.



16
UiPath
By default, the start of the Robot Service is triggered by user sign-in when  the service is set to run at login time. If it's not set to run at login time, opening the UiPath Assistant starts it automatically.



17
UiPath
Installing the Robot from UiPathStudioSetup.exe deploys the User Mode Robot by default. It can also be installed from UiPathStudio.msi or the command prompt.

ReadMe is an easy-to-use tool to help you build out documentation! Each documentation site that you publish on ReadMe is a project. Within a project there is space for documentation, interactive API reference guides, a changelog, and many more features. Each project within your account is published separately.

UiPath uses ReadMe for their documentation

Cross-site requests are common and legitimate
  You visit Professormesser.com
  Your browser loads text from the ProfessorMesser.com web server
  Your browser loads a video from youtube
  Your browser loads pictures form Instagram
HTML on ProfessorMesser.com directs requests from your browser
  this is normal and expected
  Most of these are unauthenticated requests



23

Cross-site request forgery
One-click attack, session riding
  XSRF, CSRF (sea surf)
Takes advantage of the trust that a web application has for the user
  The web stie trusts your browser
  requests are made without your consent or knowledge
  Attacker posts a facebook status on your account
Significant web application development oversight
  Usually a cryptographic token used to prevent forgery



24
Security+
Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
Attacker finds a vulnerable web application
  Sends requests to a web server
  web server performs the request on behalf of the attacker
Caused by bad programming
  Never trust the user input
  Server should validate the input and the responses
  These are rare but critical vulnerabilities

Shimming is filling a space between two objects.
Windows has its own shim
  Backwards compatibility with previous windows versions
  Applications Compatibility Shim Cache
Malware authors write their own shims
  Get around security like UAC
Jan 2015 Microsoft vulnerability
  Elevated privilege

An SSL stripping or HTTP downgrade attack combines an on-path attack with a downgrade attack
Attacker must sit in the middle of the conversation
  Must modify data between the victim and web server
  Proxy server, ARP spoofing, rogue WIfi hotspt, etc
Victim does not see any significant problem
  Except browser pages are not encrypted (http vs https)
This is a client and server problem

Raceconditions can cause big problems
Jan 2004 Mars rover "Spirit"
  Reboot when problem identified
  Problem was with the file system, but fs corrupted in boot process
  Reboot loop was result
GE - Energy Management System
  Three power lines failed at teh same time, race condition delayed alerts
  Caused Northeast Blackout of 2003
