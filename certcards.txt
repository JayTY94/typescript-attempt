Replay Attack

Useful information is transmitted over the network
  A crafty hacker will take advantage of this
Need access to raw network data
  Network tap, ARP poisoning, Malware on the victim computer



20
Security+
Replay Attack

Information gathered from network can help attacker
  Replay the data to appear as someone else
This is not an on-path attack
  The actual replay doesn't require the original workstation



21
Security+
Header manipulation
Information gathering
  Wireshark, Kismet
Exploits
  Cross-site scripting
Modify headers
  Tamper, firesheep, scapy
Modify cookies
  Cookies Manager+ (Firefox add-on)



22

Cross-site requests are common and legitimate
  You visit Professormesser.com
  Your browser loads text from the ProfessorMesser.com web server
  Your browser loads a video from youtube
  Your browser loads pictures form Instagram
HTML on ProfessorMesser.com directs requests from your browser
  this is normal and expected
  Most of these are unauthenticated requests



23
Security+
Cross-site request forgery
One-click attack, session riding
  XSRF, CSRF (sea surf)
Takes advantage of the trust that a web application has for the user
  The web stie trusts your browser
  requests are made without your consent or knowledge
  Attacker posts a facebook status on your account
Significant web application development oversight
  Usually a cryptographic token used to prevent forgery



24
Security+
Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
Attacker finds a vulnerable web application
  Sends requests to a web server
  web server performs the request on behalf of the attacker
Caused by bad programming
  Never trust the user input
  Server should validate the input and the responses
  These are rare but critical vulnerabilities



25
Security+
Shimming is filling a space between two objects.
Windows has its own shim
  Backwards compatibility with previous windows versions
  Applications Compatibility Shim Cache
Malware authors write their own shims
  Get around security like UAC
Jan 2015 Microsoft vulnerability
  Elevated privilege



26
Security+
An SSL stripping or HTTP downgrade attack combines an on-path attack with a downgrade attack
Attacker must sit in the middle of the conversation
  Must modify data between the victim and web server
  Proxy server, ARP spoofing, rogue WIfi hotspt, etc
Victim does not see any significant problem
  Except browser pages are not encrypted (http vs https)
This is a client and server problem



27
Security+
Raceconditions can cause big problems
Jan 2004 Mars rover "Spirit"
  Reboot when problem identified
  Problem was with the file system, but fs corrupted in boot process
  Reboot loop was result
GE - Energy Management System
  Three power lines failed at teh same time, race condition delayed alerts
  Caused Northeast Blackout of 2003

General
Commercial off-the-shelf or commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) products are packaged or canned (ready-made) hardware or software, which are adapted aftermarket to the needs of the purchasing organization, rather than the commissioning of custom-made, or bespoke, solutions. A related term, Mil-COTS, refers to COTS products for use by the U.S. military.

Security+
Improper error handling
Erros happen, and you should probably know about them
Messages should be just informational enough
	Avoid too much detail
	Network information
	Memory dump
	Stack traces
	Database dumps
This is an easy one to find and fix
	A development best practice



5
Security+
Resource exhaustion attack
A specified DoS (Denial of Service) attack
	May only require one device and low bandwidths
ZIP bomb
	A 42 KB .zip file uncompresses to 4.5 petabytes
	Antivirus will ID these
DHCP starvation
	Attacker floods a network with IP addresss requests, different MAC every time
	Switch configurations can rate limit DHCP requests.



6
Security+
Rogue access points - An unauthorized wireless accesss point
	May be added by an employee or an attacker
	Not necessarily malicious
	A significant potential backdoor
Very easy to plug in a wireless AP
	Or enable wireless sharing in your OS
Schedule a periodic survey
	Walk around your building/campus
	Use third-party tools/ WiFi Pineapple (poses as a rouge AP)



7
Security+
Wireless evil twins - look legitimate, but actually malicious
	Wireless version of phishing
Configure an access point to look like an existing network
	Same or similar SSID and security settings/captive portal
Overpower the exsting access points
	May not require the same physical location
WiFi hotspots (and users) are easy to fool, and they're wide open



8
Security+
Bluejacking - sending unsolicited messages to another device via bluetooth
	No mobile carrier required
Typical functional distance is about 10 meters
	More or less, depending on the antenna and interference
Bluejack with an address book object
	Instead of contact name, write a message "You are Bluejacked"
	"You are Bluejacked! Add to contacts?"
Generally low priority because it's generally just sending a message



9
Security+
Bluesnarfing - access a BT-enabled device and transfer data
	Contact list, calendar, email, pictures, video, etc.
First major security weakness in BT
	Marcel Holtmann in Sept 2003 and Adam Laurie in Nov 2003
	Weakness was patched
	Still need to look out for on older devices



10
Security+
A Wireless deauthentication attack or a Wireless Disassociation attack is a denial of service attack that is specifically causing devices that are on the wireless network to suddenly not be able to communicate at all to the access point.



11
Security+
802.11 management frames
	Communication that makes wifi work
	How to find APs, manage QoS, associate/disassociate with an AP
Original wireless standards did not add protection for management frames
	Sent in clear, no authentication or validation



12
Security+
Wireless Jaming - many different types
	Constant, random bits/Constant, legitiate frames
	Data sent at random times - random data and legitimate frames
	Reactive jamming - only when someone else tries to communicate
Needs to be somewhere close
Time to go fox hunting
	Need right equipment
	Directional antenna, attenuator



13
Security+
RFID attacks
Data capture
	View communication or replay attack
Spoof the reader and write your own data to the tag
Denial of service by jamming used frequencies
Decrypt communication - many default keys are on google



14
Security+
Near field communication (NFC)
Two-way wireless communication, related to RFID which is mostly one way
Payment systems (phones or cards)
Bootstraps for other wireless
	NFC helps with bluetooth pairing like with Airpods
Access token, identity "card"
	short range with encryption support



15
Security+
NFC security concerns
Remote capture
	It's a wireless network
	10 meters for active devices
Frequency jamming - Denial of service
Relay/Replay attack - On-path attack
Loss of RFC device control
	Stolen or lost phone



16
Security+
Cryptographic nonce
Arbitrary number, used once
	Comes from phrase "for the nonce" or "for the time being"
A random or pseudo-random number
	Something that can't be reasonably guessed, but can also be a counter
Use a nonce during a login process
	Server gives you a nonce
	Calculate your password hash using the nonce
	Each password hash sent to the host will be different, so a replay won't work



17
Security+
A type of nonce we commonly use in encryption is an Initialization Vector, or an IV. This is a way to add randomization to the encryption scheme that’s being used. If we’re able to add this initialization vector to an encryption key that we’re using, especially a key that we’re using over and over again, it will make the overall encryption method that much stronger

24
Automation Hub
The automation initiatives are at the core of any RPA program. In Automation Hub they are called automation ideas, because this is how they originate. And even as they advance through their lifecycle by being assessed, qualified and finally implemented, we continue calling them automation ideas.



25
Automation Hub
Reusable Components

Simply put, these are reusable parts of the automations being developed, such as custom activities, templates or connectors. Having these available in a single place drives effectiveness, by avoiding duplication of efforts, as well as code quality. That's exactly what Automation Hub offers through the component gallery feature.





26
Automation Hub
