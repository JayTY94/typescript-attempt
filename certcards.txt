 A hash collision is when you have two very different types of plain text, but both of those plain text create exactly the same hash. This is something that should never happen.

And if we’re able to find a hash collision, we may be able to take advantage of this inconsistency in the hash algorithm. With the hash collision, the attacker spends their time finding that other type of plain text that matches that hash.



22
Security +
The operating system itself may have safeguards in place to prevent someone from taking advantage of a privileged escalation.

One of these safeguards is called data execution prevention it’s a way to only allow applications to run in certain areas of memory where that particular function is allowed. Vulnerabilities that try to run an application from the data section of memory would be blocked using data execution prevention.



23

Non-persistent (reflected) XSS attack
  Web site allows scripts to run in user input, commonly search box
  Attacker emailsa link that takes advantage of this vulnerability
    Runs a script that sends credentials/session IDs/cookies to attacker
  Script embedded in URL executes in victim's browser





24
Security +
Persistent (stored) Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  Attacker posts a message to a social network
    Includes malicious payload
  It is not "persistent"
    Everyone who sees the post gets the payload
  Payload is some kind of script, probably javascript.

Code Injection - Adding yoru own information into a data stream
  Enabled because of bad programming - The application should properly handle input and output
  So many different data types
    HTML, SQL, XML, LDAP, etc



26
Security +
DLL injection
  Dynamic-Link Library
    A windows library contianing code and data
    Many applications can use this library
  Inject a DLL and have an application run a program
    Runs as part of the program

A buffer overflow attack occurs when one section of memory is able to overwrite a different section of memory. This type of overriding or spilling over of memory should not occur, and if someone is able to replicate that in a way that’s controllable, they may be able to gain access to the system or cause an application to perform the way that they would like. 



28
Security +
A good buffer overflow for an attacker is one that they can both replicate and one that they can control. This is not a simple exploit to find, and it’s not an easy exploit for an attacker to take advantage of. It’s very difficult to find some software that would allow this buffer overflow, and then it’s very difficult to have a buffer overflow that might not cause the system to become unstable or to crash.

UiPath
Main capabilities of Orchestrator
Control and license distribution: Orchestrator also enables the creation, assignment, and maintenance of licenses, roles, permissions, groups, and folder hierarchies. 


Running automation jobs in unattended mode: as presented earlier, it enables the creation and distribution of automation jobs in various ways, including through queues and triggers. 




10
UiPath
Main Capabilities of Orchestrator
Automation storage and distribution: Orchestrator is the environment enabling the controlled storage and distribution of automation projects, assets, and credentials, as well as large files used in automations. 


11
UiPath
Main Capabilities of Orchestrator
Monitoring: with Orchestrator, admins are able to monitor jobs and robots. It also stores logs for auditing and analytics. 

Inter-connectivity: finally, Orchestrator acts as the centralized point of communication for third-party solutions or applications. 


12
UiPath
RPA Developers create automation projects in Studio. Projects are published as packages to Orchestrator. Published packages paired with folders become processes.



13
UiPath
Orchestrator sends job info to unattended robots. Unattended robots communcicate with the orchestrator through a heartbeat mechanism.



14
UiPath
By now you are familiar with UiPath Robot, the component of the UiPath Platform. This is an execution host that runs automation processes published in Orchestrator, as jobs.

In Orchestrator, a robot entity represents an image or the Robot component, controlling its connection and capabilities. The robot entity exists only if it is defined in relation to a user in Orchestrator. 



15
UiPath
Folders enable the separation and hierarchical organization of automation entities (processes, queues, assets) and the fine-grained configuration of roles and permissions. The hierarchical structure allows up to 6 sub-folders under each first level folder. 

Folders help replicate the organizational hierarchies, with the separation of automated processes between teams, segregation of process data, and access control for users. At the same time, when it makes sense, they allow sharing of the resources and assets. 



16
UiPath
A project developed in UiPath Studio that is published to Orchestrator as a NuGet package. Multiple versions of the same project can be stored and used.

Packages can also be manually uploaded to Orchestrator.

Additionally, by viewing the versions for a package you can download it from Orchestrator



17
UiPath
It is a version of a package that's been allocated to a certain folder.

Given that most processes use a queue, asset, or storage bucket, the Package Requirements tab, for when adding a new process, makes it easy to identify which entities your package is using and if they are missing from your folder.



18
UiPath
A job represents the execution of a process on a UiPath Robot. You can launch the execution of a job in either attended or unattended mode. You cannot launch a job from Orchestrator on attended robots, unless for debugging purposes using personal workspaces, and they cannot run under a locked screen. 



19
UiPath
Attended and unattended robots send a heartbeat to Orchestrator every 30 seconds. This signals to Orchestrator that the connection is working.





20
UiPath
Both human users and robots are uniquely identified with users in Orchestrator.





21
UiPath
Machine (Orchestrator entity)
–
These are Orchestrator entities corresponding to the workstations where human users and robots work. Using API keys, they enable the connection between the physical machines and Orchestrator.



22
UiPath
License
–
The right to use Studio and/or Robots, both attended and unattended, is done through licenses. Licenses exist at tenant level, from where they get distributed to users, and consumed when the machines connect to Orchestrator.



23
UiPath
Webhook
–
Webhooks facilitate the communication between Orchestrator and other applications at API level. These are mapped at tenant level, which means they cannot be differentiated between folders and will provide information for the entire tenant.



24
UiPath
Trigger
–
Triggers enable the execution of jobs in a structured manner. There are two types of triggers:

Time triggers: with these, you can schedule the recurrent execution of a process.
Queue triggers: these enable the execution of a process based on the new items added to a queue.



25
UiPath
In order to access and run automations, both human users and robots need roles.



26
UiPath
To successfully run a job with an unattended robot:

Under Robot Setup, the Unattended Robot is enabled for the user or robot account.
The workstation on which the unattended robot runs is connected to Orchestrator using a machine template.
The user or robot and the machine template are in the same folder as the process you want to run.
Unattended runtimes (licenses) are available on the tenant.



27
UiPath
Robot accounts have to be created in Automation Cloud, and they behave like user accounts regarding permissions. The only differences compared to user accounts are: 

Robot accounts are not allowed to have any interactive-related process configuration.
No email address is required to create a robot account.



28
UiPath
To simplify the attended and unattended robot creation, as well as the license provisioning, the automation robot creation can be enabled at user level, for both attended and unattended robots, and at group level for attended robots.

Basically, you enable the Attended Robot or Unattended Robot toggle at the account or group level, configure the various settings (robot execution settings, machine login credentials, if applicable), and a floating robot with those attributes is created.



29
UiPath
There are two types of machines in Orchestrator:

Machine templates: this allows the connection to multiple workstations with a single API key.




30
UiPath
There are two types of machines in Orchestrator:
Standard machines: this allows the connection between Orchestrator and a single machine. This is suitable for scenarios in which robots need to run on specific machines.


1
UiPath
On a regular Windows machine, only one user can run. But on a Windows server machine, multiple users can run simultaneously.

Licenses are consumed as soon as a machine is connected to Orchestrator, no matter the number of users running on it.





2
UiPath
The process, the user and the machine template need to be mapped to the folder in order to run an unattended job. The package is a tenant entity, therefore not mapped to the folder.



3
UiPath
A point to remember right from the beginning is that unattended robots do not exist as independent entities. As we saw in the previous lesson, they are a combination between a user or robot account and a machine. From this perspective, a better name for a robot is execution slot.



4
UiPath
One important mention here before going further. The ability to allocate more than one runtime and to execute several processes on the same machine is applicable only for Windows Server machines.





5
UiPath
Which of the following folder entities can be configured to be accessed/executed only by a certain unattended robot?

Asset
Trigger
Job
not Queue



6
UiPath
Which of the following folder entities can be configured to be accessed/executed only by a certain unattended robot?
Trigger
Job

7
UiPath
Which of the following entities need to be mapped to the folder in order to run an unattended job?
User or Robot
Process 
Machine Template
Not Queues
Not Package



8
UiPath
[FALSE] When a user is being imported from Active Directory, the automation robot creation can be configured only for the attended robot, but not for the unattended one.

UiPath
	• UiPath Robot
The execution host that runs processes designed in UiPath Studio



10
UiPath
	• Robot (Orchestrator object)
Orchestrator object used to define the capabilities and privileges of a UiPath Robot such as access to folder resources, machine login credentials, etc. In this guide, it is often referred to as a robot, robot object, robot entity.



11
UiPath
	• Machine (host machine)
The physical or virtual machine used to host and deploy a UiPath Robot. In this guide, it is referred to as the host machine, workstation, or server, to differentiate it from the machine object in Orchestrator



12
UiPath
	• Machine (Orchestrator object)
Orchestrator object that works as an API key generator, authorizing the usage of a UiPath Robot on a host machine. For unattended use cases, it also allows administrators to configure the execution capacity for the associated host machine(s). For more information, see About Machines



13
UiPath
The article "About Robots in Orchestrator" in the UiPath documentation is great.



14
UiPath
You cannot typically start or trigger processes in Orchestrator on attended robots, and they cannot run under a locked screen. They can only be started from UiPath assistant or the Command Prompt.



15
UiPath
An exception to the rule that attended automations must be launched from UiPath assistant or the Command prompt is process debugging, where users, generally RPA developers, can launch processes from Orchestrator on attended robots. This can be done via personal workspaces which allow launching processes in Orchestrator on attended robots by using the machine template automatically generated by virtue of being a personal workspace owner. Read more about personal workspaces.



16
UiPath
By default, the start of the Robot Service is triggered by user sign-in when  the service is set to run at login time. If it's not set to run at login time, opening the UiPath Assistant starts it automatically.



17
UiPath
Installing the Robot from UiPathStudioSetup.exe deploys the User Mode Robot by default. It can also be installed from UiPathStudio.msi or the command prompt.
