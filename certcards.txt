Recipes are automated workflows built by users that can span multiple apps, such as moving new accounts from Salesforce into Zendesk as new organizations. Each recipe comprises of a trigger and one or more actions that are carried out when a trigger event is picked up.



7
Workato
Triggers determine what event to listen to execute the actions described in a recipe.

Trigger events can be set off in apps (Salesforce or JIRA) when a certain event happens (new contact is created or existing ticket updated), when a new line is added in a file, or according to a schedule (fires at a certain time or interval).

Workato
Every step, including triggers, brings data into the recipe. For example a new employee in Workday trigger would bring in employee data. This data is made available in the recipe via the datatree.

The individual data fields are called datapills. You can use the datapills in subsequent steps.
