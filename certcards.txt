Data is always arranged in a process data model that consists of an activity table, a case table, and an unlimited number of aditional tables with relations of the tables defined by the foreign keys.

What are the challenges when extracting event data?
  Finding the data - ID the system that will be the source
  Extracting the data - setting up the pipeline
  Understand the data - know the schema/foreign key relationships

What are the challenges when extracting event data?
  Quality problems - eg MM/DD/yyyy or DD/MM/yyyy
  Scalability - manually uploading data is too limited
  Data security and regulations

An important aspect of that is the existence of common and widely-accepted standards, one of it being the data format for event logs.  XES is an XML-based format, and its name is an acronym for eXtensible Event Stream

There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Deficiency - Events disappear from the data set due to missing representation in the flattened event log.

There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Convergence - Unintentional duplication due to events referring to multiple objects being replicated

There are multiple problems that we encounter when we try to convert an object-centered event log into a conventional event log

Divergence - Wrong causal relation, 2 events being related to 2 different object not selected as the case.

We distinguish between two features types. Static features do not change throughout a case and always remain the same. Examples could be Customer or Material Number.



24
Celonis
We distinguish between two features types. Dynamic features are features that change over time and need to be updated throughout a case. Examples are counts of how often a certain activity already occurred in the process.



25
Celonis
When building a training set Static and Dynamic features need to be treated differently since they should not have the last state of a case but the state at a given time in the process.

If you're looking for operational friction, focus on the cases that are infrequent and that you don't want to happen.

Machine Learning can be applied after data is imported, cleaned, analyized, and reorganized into feature sets. This is one of the last things that Celonis can do, and it's unlikely that our customers will get to it.

Machine Learning in Celonis is demonstrated to help predict with real time data which cases are likely to be delayed so that corrective action can be taken. Again, this is probably beyond the capacity of Hawaii companies to use.

General 
The Pareto principle or "80-20 rule" stating that 80% of outcomes are due to 20% of causes was named in honour of Pareto, but the concepts are distinct, and only Pareto distributions with shape value (α) of log45 ≈ 1.16 precisely reflect it. Empirical observation has shown that this 80-20 distribution fits a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena[5] and human activities.[6][7] the principle originally applied to describing the distribution of wealth in a society, fitting the trend that a large portion of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population

Malware authors will also use websites to embed their links and have pop-up messages to entice you to click those links and download the software so that they can then run that malware on your local computer. They might also use these web pages to automatically download software to your computer and then encourage you to run that software using a technique called a drive-by download.

A virus is malware that can reproduce itself, but one of the unique characteristics of a virus is that it needs you– the end user– to click on or launch that application to start the virus replication process. This is something that differentiates a virus from a worm.



6
Security +
If the virus is never saving itself to the storage drive, then it may be able to evade the antivirus software. Instead of existing as a file that might execute, the fileless virus operates solely in the memory of the computer. Once it’s started, all of the operations happen inside of RAM, and nothing is ever written to the storage drive on your system.

Crypto-malware uses cryptography to be able to encrypt all of your personal information and make it so that none of that information can be decrypted unless you have the proper key. The way that you obtain that key is that you send the attackers money or Bitcoin

One type of software that’s commonly downloaded by this Trojan horse software is a PUP. This is a potentially unwanted program. This may not be malicious software, but it could be undesirable and may cause performance problems on your computer.

A type of software that attackers might install as part of the back door is a Remote Access Trojan, or a RAT. You might also hear this referred to as a Remote Administration Tool. This is a remote access tool that gives a third party access to your computer to have nearly complete control over the operating system.

A common characteristic of a rootkit is, instead of modifying files in your operating system, it’s modifying files in the kernel of the operating system.

Spyware is a bit more malicious than adware, because it’s trying to find out things about you or to gather information about you. Spyware might be looking to see where you visit on the internet. It might be trying to identify personal information about you so that it can use that for identity theft,

The bot malware on a computer is working along with other computers that are infected with the same bot malware to create a botnet. This botnet is controlled through a Command and Control server or C&C server. The C&C server is responsible for sending out commands.

It’s difficult to identify if a logic bomb has been placed in a system because it doesn’t follow any known signature. It’s not possible for antivirus or anti-malware to automatically recognize that a logic bomb may exist. It also might be difficult to gather evidence after the fact, because many logic bombs will delete themselves once they’ve executed.

A spraying attack avoids the results of a locked account for trying the wrong password over and over again without success. Instead, a spraying attack is going to try to use some very common passwords and only try a few of them before moving on.

With Brute Force attacks,  it’s common for the attacker to have already downloaded the password file. They can then perform an offline attack of those hashes where they can programmatically step through every possible combination and do it very quickly on their local machine.



16

A salt is a little bit of extra random data added to the password before it is hashed. This means that if two users happen to be using exactly the same password, the hash that’s stored in the password table is going to be different between the two even though their password is exactly the same because a different type of random salt was added to each one of those user’s passwords.

This looks like a perfectly normal USB cable. We would use it to plug into our computer and charge our systems, except it has some additional electronics inside. It could, in fact, tell your operating system that it is a HID, or a human interface device.

A good example of poisoned training data occurred with a Microsoft AI chatter bot named Tay. Tay stands for thinking about you. And Tay was added to Twitter on March 23, 2016. It was able to hold conversations with Twitter users. But Microsoft didn’t add any type of anti-offensive behavior or anti-offensive learning algorithms to Tay.

So once Tay started interacting with other users and other users realized that they could poison the learning process, they turned into a racist, sexist, and inappropriate bot.

 A hash collision is when you have two very different types of plain text, but both of those plain text create exactly the same hash. This is something that should never happen.

And if we’re able to find a hash collision, we may be able to take advantage of this inconsistency in the hash algorithm. With the hash collision, the attacker spends their time finding that other type of plain text that matches that hash.

The operating system itself may have safeguards in place to prevent someone from taking advantage of a privileged escalation.

One of these safeguards is called data execution prevention it’s a way to only allow applications to run in certain areas of memory where that particular function is allowed. Vulnerabilities that try to run an application from the data section of memory would be blocked using data execution prevention.
