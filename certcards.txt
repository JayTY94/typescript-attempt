On-Path browser attack
What if the middleman was on the same computer as the victim?
	Malware/Trojan does all of the proxy work
	Formerly known as man-in-the-browser
Huge advantages for the attackers
	Relatively easy to proxy encrypted traffic
	Everything looks normal to the victim



13
Security+
Lan switching
Forward or drop frames
	Based on the destination MAC address
Switches gather a constantly updating list of MAC addresses
	Builds the list based on teh source MAC address of incoming traffic
	These age out periodically, often in 5 minutes
Maintain a loop-free environment
	Using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)



14
Security+
MAC flooding
The MAC table on a switch is only so big
Attacker starts sending traffic with different MAC addressses
	Forces out he legitimate MAC addresses
The table fills up
	Switch begins flooding server traffic to all interfaces



15
Security+
Mac flooding
Effectively turns a switch into a hub
	All traffic is transmitted to all interfaces
	No interruption in traffic flows
Attacker can easily capture all network traffic
Flooding can be restricted in the switch's port security setting



16
Security+
MAC cloning/MAC spoofing
An attacker changes their MAC address to match the MAC of an existing device
This allows them to circumvent filters
	Wireless or wired MAC filters
	Identify a valid MAC address and copy it




17
Security+
MAC cloning/MAC spoofing
Create a Denial of Service (DoS)
	Intercept and thus deny all communication the legitimate device receives
Easily manipulated through software
	Usually a device driver option

A trial balance is a worksheet with two columns, one for debits and one for credits, that ensures a company’s bookkeeping is mathematically correct. The debits and credits include all business transactions for a company over a certain period, including the sum of such accounts as assets, expenses, liabilities, and revenues.

In computing, Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standard application programming interface (API) for accessing database management systems (DBMS). The designers of ODBC aimed to make it independent of database systems and operating systems.



29
UiPath
At the start of each Process Mining implementation, we need to load the data. UiPath Process Mining supports different methods to load the data. The most common ones are establishing an ODBC connection, reading from a flat file (csv, xlsx), or making a direct connection with SAP.

Domain hijacking
There are many ways to get into the account that controls a domain
	Brute force the password

Domain Hijacking example
Saturday, Oct 22, 2016
Domain name registrations of 36 domains were changed
	Owned by a Brazillian bank
Under hacker control for 6 hours
5 million customers, $27 billion in assets
	Results of the hack have not been publicly released

URL Hijacking
Making money from your mistakes (typos)
	Just directing you to a page that has adds
Might to go to a phishing site
	Looks like the real site; please login
Might also infect with a drive-by download

Security +
URL Hijacking
Might sell the badly spelled domain to the owner of the site they're attacking
Might also redirect to a compnetitor
	Not as common and has legal issues




7
Security +
Domain repulation
Infected web servers are noticed by search engines
	Your domain can be flagged or removed
Will put a big "This site contains malware" page up before directing people to your site
Malware might be removed quickly, but recovery of reputation takes much longer.

JS to speed up video playback if the player does not have a control for it
you could open the browser console (ctrl+shift+i), click on console. Then execute following

	document.querySelector('video').playbackRate = 1.5

works like a charm for me.

UiPath Task Mining
In Task Mining, there are two main personas using the product:

	• Task Mining Admin: responsible for the set-up of Task Mining projects and configuring them in the UiPath Automation Cloud



24
UiPath Task Mining
In Task Mining, there are two main personas using the product:

	User: The employee who performs the task that will be analyzed with the help of Task Mining



25
UiPath Task Mining
Throughout a Task Mining project, some other roles might get involved to support during some stages of the process.
	• The automation Center of Excellence Lead: They can be involved in the initial phase of a project when we need to identify the business lines, processes, and users that are going to be part of the Task Mining project.
		○ The Automation COE leads can also sometimes coincide with the Task Mining Admin




26
UiPath Task Mining
Throughout a Task Mining project, some other roles might get involved to support during some stages of the process.
	• The Subject Matter Expert: users with lots of expertise in performing the task. After the data has been recorded and analyzed  using an ML package, the SME, the Admin, and the Business Analyst can work together to understand which task variation is the desired one and where is the biggest potential for automation.




27
UiPath Task Mining
Throughout a Task Mining project, some other roles might get involved to support during some stages of the process.
	• The Business Analyst: they can join the SMEs and Admins in understanding how a task was performed, identifying opportunities for process improvement, and choosing the tasks with the highest automation potential.




28
UiPath Task Mining
Throughout a Task Mining project, some other roles might get involved to support during some stages of the process.
	• The Automation Developer: they usually come at the end of the analysis. Starting from process design documents and .xaml file exports, they build the automation project for the selected tasks.




29
UiPath Task Mining
Before starting the recording process, instruct users on a few best practices to take into consideration while they are performing their tasks:

	Have all the users consistently record for the defined period of time
		This will avoid having one user recording a significantly larger amount of data and skew the results



30
UiPath Task Mining
Before starting the recording process, instruct users on a few best practices to take into consideration while they are performing their tasks:

	Instruct the users to finish one iteration of a task at a time
		For example, process one invoice, then another. Instruct them to avoid processing the second invoice if the first one is not complete.

UiPath Task Mining
The Task Mining admin console automatically creates a dataset under the Datasets section in the AI Center project we created and linked with our Task Mining project



2
UiPath Task Mining
If the Admin chose the Continuous option in the Output Configuration section of the Task Mining project, the data captured was automatically pushed as a dataset in AI Center. If the Admin chose 'Via shared drive', they will have to explicitly push the recorded data from the network location to the AI Center project



3
UiPath Task Mining
Then, the easiest option is to run the out-of-the-box ML model for Task Mining from AI Center. To do this:
	Select the UiPath Task Mining package under the ML Packages section in the AI Center project. Select the Model version, hit Submit, then enter the Package Name and the Description. Finally, hit Submit.
	Select the Evaluation run pipeline for the out-of-the-box Task Mining model and pass the dataset created by Task Mining console



4
UiPath Task Mining
The ML model run will take between few hours and two days based on the size of the dataset

Once the model completes the execution, the results will be automatically uploaded to the Task Mining project, under Discovery results.

UiPath Task Mining
UiPath recomends collecting at least 40k actions for any analysis and 100k-200k actions for more optimal results.
